[00:00:00] I'm back with Reiner Pope, CEO 
of MatX, a new AI chip company. 

[00:00:04] Last time we were talking about 
what happens inside a data center. 

[00:00:07] Now I want to understand what 
happens inside an AI chip. 

[00:00:10] How does a chip actually work?
Full disclosure, by the way:  

[00:00:13] I am an angel investor in MatX.
So hopefully you have designed a good chip. 

[00:00:19] Hope so. I'll start with the smallest 
fundamental unit of chip design, and we'll  

[00:00:25] build up to what an actual production 
chip is and what its components are. 

[00:00:30] At the very bottom level of a chip, the 
primitives we work with are logic gates,  

[00:00:37] very simple things like AND, OR, and NOT.
These are connected together by wires that have to  

[00:00:42] be laid out physically as metal traces on a chip.
The main function that AI chips want to compute  

[00:00:50] is the multiplication of matrices.
Inside that, the fundamental primitive  

[00:00:54] is a multiply-accumulate of pairs of numbers.
We're going to demonstrate what that calculation  

[00:01:01] looks like by hand, and then infer what 
a circuit would look like for that. 

[00:01:08] It'll be easiest if I do a multiply-accumulate of 
a four-bit number with another four-bit number. 

[00:01:20] The clearest primitive is 
actually multiply-accumulate. 

[00:01:24] So there's a multiply of these two terms, and 
then we're going to add in an eight-bit number. 

[00:01:40] Can I ask a clarifying question?
Why is this the natural primitive for  

[00:01:49] whatever computation happens inside a computer?
There are a few reasons. 

[00:01:55] It's a little bit more efficient, but the 
reason it's natural for AI chips is that if  

[00:02:00] you look at what's happening during a matrix 
multiply… What is a matrix multiply in short? 

[00:02:09] There's a for-loop over i, over 
j, and over k, of output [i,  

[00:02:21] k] += input [i, j] x other input [j, k].
A multiply-accumulate happens at every  

[00:02:36] single step of a matrix multiply.
The other observation is that the  

[00:02:40] precision will almost always be higher in the 
accumulation step than in the multiplication step. 

[00:02:45] This is specific to AI chips.
You're multiplying low-precision numbers,  

[00:02:49] and then when you accumulate, errors accumulate 
quickly, so you need more precision there. 

[00:02:54] This is why we've chosen to do a four-bit 
multiplication and an eight-bit addition. 

[00:02:58] Let me make sure I understood that.
There are two ways to understand that. 

[00:03:01] One is that the value will 
be larger than the inputs. 

[00:03:06] The other is that if it was a 
floating-point number it would be…  

[00:03:10] Maybe that part is less intuitive to me.
But maybe it's the same principle? 

[00:03:14] It really is the same principle.
The separate principle is that as  

[00:03:20] you're summing up this number, you're summing 
up a whole bunch of numbers, so you've got a  

[00:03:23] lot of rounding errors accumulating.
Whereas in this case, there's only  

[00:03:28] one multiplication in the chain, 
so there aren't a lot of rounding  

[00:03:30] errors accumulating in the multiplication.
Why are you summing up a whole bunch of numbers? 

[00:03:33] There’s just two numbers there.
This summation is repeated j many times. 

[00:03:39] Any errors accumulate. I see.
So how would we perform this calculation by hand? 

[00:03:45] As a human, we would probably 
separate it into two, but we can do  

[00:03:48] it all in one using long multiplication.
For the multiplication term first, we're  

[00:03:55] going to multiply this four-bit number by every 
single bit position in the other four-bit number. 

[00:04:03] We write that out. First, 1001 
multiplied by this bit position. 

[00:04:10] That is the number itself.
Then shifted across by one,  

[00:04:14] we're multiplying by 0.
That gives us an all-0 number. 

[00:04:20] Shifted across one more to 
multiply by this one, we get 1001. 

[00:04:28] Finally, for this last bit position, 
we get an all-0 number again. 

[00:04:37] This gives us a bunch of terms that 
we have to add for the multiplication. 

[00:04:43] While we're doing that summation, we might as 
well add in the actual accumulator term as well. 

[00:04:50] So we just copy that directly across.
So this is the sum. 

[00:05:00] It's a five-way sum that we want to compute. 

[00:05:07] What logic gates did it take us 
to get to this intermediate step? 

[00:05:12] We needed to produce all 16 
of these partial products. 

[00:05:17] How do I produce one of these partial products?
Let's take this number 1, for example here. 

[00:05:26] We produce it by multiplying this 
number by this one over here. 

[00:05:31] We can produce that with an AND gate.
This number is 1 if both this bit  

[00:05:35] is 1 and this bit is 1.
If either of them is 0,  

[00:05:37] then the multiplication of 0 times anything is 0.
To produce all of this, we ended up  

[00:05:45] consuming 16 AND gates.
In the general case,  

[00:05:50] if I were doing a p bit multiply times a q bit 
multiply, this will be p times q many ANDs. 

[00:06:10] Finally, I sum them. Most of the work 
is going to happen in the summing. 

[00:06:15] Let me describe the other 
logic gate that we use here. 

[00:06:20] AND is almost the simplest logic 
gate that exists on a chip. 

[00:06:23] It's almost the smallest. At the other extreme, 
the very largest logic gate you'll typically use  

[00:06:30] is something called a full adder.
Coming from software, you might think  

[00:06:39] that a full adder adds 32-bit numbers together.
In this case, it just adds three single-bit  

[00:06:43] numbers together, so you can think 
of it as adding 0, 1, and 1 together. 

[00:06:50] When I add these together, the result can 
be 0, 1, 2, or 3, so I can express that  

[00:06:54] in binary using just two bits.
As input, it has three bits. 

[00:06:58] As output, it has two bits.
The number 2 in binary is 10. 

[00:07:06] This is also known as a 3→2 compressor 
because it takes three bits of input  

[00:07:17] and produces two bits of output.
Just to make sure I understood: the  

[00:07:19] two inputs are an X and a Y value 
and then some carry that came in… 

[00:07:27] The three inputs are all bits in the same bit 
position, like three bits in a column here. 

[00:07:35] The two outputs, I've drawn them vertically 
here and horizontally here to match this  

[00:07:41] vertical versus horizontal layout.
This expresses that things in the same  

[00:07:45] column are in the same bit position, whereas 
things in adjacent columns are different. 

[00:07:50] This is a carry out, whereas this was the sum.
So if the inputs in the full adder were, say,  

[00:07:56] 101, then the output would be 10.
If it were 111, it'd be 11. 

[00:07:59] If it were 000, it'd be 00.
If it were 010, it'd still be 01. 

[00:08:06] Got it.
Yeah. It's essentially just counting the  

[00:08:09] number of things and expressing that in binary.
This circuit captures what we as humans naturally  

[00:08:17] do when we're summing along a column.
I'll show one iteration of using  

[00:08:24] the full adder to sum.
The way I sum here is going  

[00:08:27] to be a little unnatural for humans.
We would sum along the column and then  

[00:08:31] remember the carry, but instead of remembering 
the carry, we'll explicitly write it out. 

[00:08:39] We proceed from the rightmost 
column toward the left. 

[00:08:42] On the rightmost column, we sum the 1 and the 1, 
and that produces a zero here and a carry of one. 

[00:08:51] We've used this full adder circuit on this pair 
of bits and produced a pair of bits as output. 

[00:08:59] Now we can do the same thing with this column.
We have a column of four numbers, so we'll take  

[00:09:04] the first three of them, run a full adder on 
them, and that gives us a 0 and a 0 as output. 

[00:09:12] The sum of these is 00.
That's the full adder applied to all these bits. 

[00:09:18] As I've used up bits, I'll cross them 
out to indicate that I've handled them. 

[00:09:25] Let's keep going a little bit more.
I take these three numbers, I add  

[00:09:31] them, and that gives me a 1 and a 0.
I've dealt with these three numbers. 

[00:09:36] Now I take these three numbers and add 
them, and that gives me a 1 and a 0,  

[00:09:44] and I've dealt with these numbers.
The way to view this is that I have  

[00:09:51] this whole grid of numbers that need to be added.
I'm going to keep applying full adders to all the  

[00:09:57] bits here, constantly removing three numbers from 
a column and writing out two numbers as output. 

[00:10:03] Keep going over and over again until I 
eventually get just one single number coming out. 

[00:10:16] This approach is called a Dadda multiplier.
This is the standard for how you do  

[00:10:31] area-efficient multipliers using full adders.
Let's try to quantify the circuit size of  

[00:10:38] this so we have a sense of how big 
things are and can compare them later. 

[00:10:44] How many full adders did I use?
How many numbers did I start with? 

[00:10:50] I have the 16 partial products, which is a product 
of all of these terms with all of these terms,  

[00:10:57] plus the eight terms that I'm adding here.
I started off with 24 bits. 

[00:11:06] Eventually I produced eight bits on the output.
In every step, I was crossing off three numbers  

[00:11:14] and writing two numbers out as a result.
Every single use of a full adder eliminates  

[00:11:20] one of the bits here.
So how many full adders? 

[00:11:23] It must be 24 minus 8, so there 
were 16 full adders in this circuit. 

[00:11:30] This is true in the general case as well.
There will be p times q many  

[00:11:34] full adders in this circuit.
Let me make sure I understand the logic of that. 

[00:11:39] The input bits, 24, is p x q, plus p + q.
The output bits are just p + q. 

[00:11:42] So p x q plus p + q, minus p + q equals p x q.
That's right. I think this explains,  

[00:12:00] or at least hints at, the second reason 
we chose to do a multiply-accumulate. 

[00:12:06] The first reason is that it's what 
shows up in matrix multiplication. 

[00:12:10] The second is that it gave us this very 
slick, simple p x q, very simple algebra. 

[00:12:17] We've described this whole procedure.
Every single atomic step that I took  

[00:12:22] here becomes a logic gate, and then 
the wires are connected together. 

[00:12:26] When I had these three inputs that I used to 
produce these two outputs, if I think of mapping  

[00:12:31] this to a physical device, there would be a wire 
connecting all three of these things together  

[00:12:38] into a logic gate that produced this output.
This is the main primitive, at different bit  

[00:12:46] widths, that's inside an AI chip.
We're going to build up from here  

[00:12:54] to how you would use it to run all 
the other operations you might want. 

[00:12:58] This might be the wrong time to ask, but 
whenever Nvidia reports that this chip  

[00:13:02] can do X many FP4 or half as many FP8, it 
seems to imply those circuits are fungible,  

[00:13:11] that there's not a dedicated FP4 versus FP8.
But the way you're mapping it out here, it seems  

[00:13:17] like if it has to be mapped out in the logic, you 
would need a dedicated FP4 multiply-accumulate and  

[00:13:27] then a dedicated FP8 accumulate.
Can you "funge" them? 

[00:13:33] As drawn, they're not particularly fungible.
This is actually one of the main choices you  

[00:13:37] have to make when designing a chip: how 
much of FP4 and how much of FP8 do I have? 

[00:13:42] Sometimes I'll make that consideration from 
the point of view of the customer requirement. 

[00:13:47] Another angle is to equalize the 
power budget between FP4 and FP8. 

[00:13:55] When they report those numbers and it just happens 
to be the case that it does 2x as many FP4 as FP8,  

[00:14:02] they're just choosing to give equivalent 
die areas to all the floating points,  

[00:14:08] and as a result it ends up being…?
Why is the ratio exactly 2x? 

[00:14:13] Part of it is that surely it won't 
be exactly equivalent to die area. 

[00:14:20] There's a data movement reason.
We'll maybe come back to this when we  

[00:14:24] look at how it goes into and out of memories.
There's something really nice from a software  

[00:14:28] level about the fact that I can pack 
two four-bit numbers into the same  

[00:14:32] storage as an eight-bit number.
When I store that to memory,  

[00:14:36] the sizing of the buses that I wire out within 
the chip makes that work out really nicely. 

[00:14:44] Come to think of it, it's not just 2x.
The amount of area it takes sounds like  

[00:14:54] it's quadratic with the bit length.
That's why smaller precision is even  

[00:15:00] more favorable than you might think.
This is a really big reason. 

[00:15:04] In fact, Nvidia made a change.
Historically, up until B100 or  

[00:15:10] B200, every time you halved the bit 
precision, you doubled the FLOP count. 

[00:15:18] For the reason you said, because of this quadratic 
scaling, that ratio is actually slightly wrong. 

[00:15:21] You should get an even bigger speedup 
than you might otherwise think. 

[00:15:28] Nvidia’s product specs have started acknowledging 
that in B300 and beyond, where the FP4 is three  

[00:15:34] times faster than the FP8.
Though it should be 4x. 

[00:15:38] Yeah. What I've shown here is the 
simplest case of integer multiply. 

[00:15:42] When you're dealing with floating point, as 
you do in FP4 and FP8, there's this other term,  

[00:15:49] the exponent, that complicates the calculation.
What can we see already from this? 

[00:15:54] I think the big observation you've made is that 
there's this quadratic scaling with bit width,  

[00:16:00] which is very effective and is 
the single reason low-precision  

[00:16:04] arithmetic has worked so well for neural nets.
The other thing we're going to do now is compare  

[00:16:11] the area spent on the multiplication 
itself with all the circuitry around it. 

[00:16:20] We'll walk back in time a little bit and 
see how GPUs prior to Tensor Cores worked,  

[00:16:28] which is in fact the same way CPUs worked.
Where do we stick this multiply-accumulate unit? 

[00:16:37] Generically, I'll describe a CUDA core or a CPU.
You'll have some register file which stores some  

[00:16:47] number of entries, maybe eight entries of, in this 
case, 4-bit numbers, but typically 32-bit numbers. 

[00:17:03] Inside the CUDA core, I'll have 
some register file of some depth,  

[00:17:06] and then I'll have my multiply-accumulate circuit.
What it's going to do is take three arbitrary  

[00:17:18] registers from this register file, 
perform the multiply-accumulate,  

[00:17:21] and then write back to the register file.
It's going to write to this one,  

[00:17:25] but it was able to read from this 
one, this one, and another random one. 

[00:17:31] It will take three inputs like this.
This is the core data path of many processors. 

[00:17:39] Most processors look like this.
You've got some set of registers, and  

[00:17:42] then you've got some set of logic units, or ALUs.
We want to analyze the cost of the data movement  

[00:17:50] from the register file to the ALU and back.
Ultimately, there's going to be some  

[00:17:58] circuit that says, "Well, I don't 
always have to select this guy. 

[00:18:01] I might select any of the 
registers at any point in time." 

[00:18:04] The first question is: how can I build a circuit?
The circuit I'm going to look for is a mux. 

[00:18:13] In this case, it's going to have eight inputs, 
one from each entry of the register file,  

[00:18:17] and it's going to have one output, 
which is actually producing this output. 

[00:18:26] What is the cost of this thing?
All we have to build it out of is AND and OR. 

[00:18:32] How do we build it?
We do the dumbest thing possible. 

[00:18:37] We form a mask. When we want to read the 
third entry, we're going to AND every  

[00:18:44] single entry with either 1 or 0 based 
on whether that's what we want to read,  

[00:18:48] and then we're going to OR all of them together.
Just to make sure I understand the basics. 

[00:18:52] What the mux is doing is just selecting an input?
Just selecting, invisible to software. 

[00:18:59] You say "I want input number three," 
and that means there's a mux here. 

[00:19:02] So what is the cost of this mux?
An n-input  

[00:19:10] mux operating on p bits.
I have n rows. That's just eight  

[00:19:21] rows, and each row is p bits wide.
I have to AND every single bit,  

[00:19:25] so I get n x p many AND gates.
For every single input I have to decide  

[00:19:32] whether I'm going to mask it out or not.
Then I'm going to OR them all together. 

[00:19:38] There's going to be n – 1 times p many OR gates.
I've got all of these different things,  

[00:19:47] almost all of them are 0s, but I need to collapse 
them from my eight options down into one option. 

[00:19:54] Every step, I need to OR one 
row into an existing row. 

[00:19:59] It's actually funny that you don't 
think at the level of hardware. 

[00:20:04] You just think, "Oh, I'll just select element 
three," and something as simple as that is  

[00:20:11] in and of itself quite a complicated circuit.
This is the first step of all of the hidden  

[00:20:15] data movement costs that show up.
We're just going to compare. 

[00:20:23] I have to pay this cost.
I've got one mux here, and in fact  

[00:20:26] I have two more copies of that for each of the 
three inputs to my multiply-accumulate operation. 

[00:20:30] I have this cost, which is 3 x n x p AND gates 
over here, compared to p x q gates in the actual  

[00:20:42] circuit that is doing the thing I care about.
If we plug in actual numbers, with n being  

[00:20:49] eight, I get 24 x p gates just in the data 
movement, compared to—if q is four—4 x p  

[00:21:00] gates just in the multiply-adder.
Where is the three coming from? 

[00:21:05] Three different inputs here. What I'm 
hinting at is that all of this work,  

[00:21:14] which scales as the size of the register 
file—and this is a very small register  

[00:21:18] file—all of this work just moving the data from 
the register file to the logic unit is many,  

[00:21:26] many times more expensive than the logic unit.
In the most recent ClusterMAX report, SemiAnalysis  

[00:21:31] ranked almost 100 different GPU clouds. Crusoe 
was one of only five that made the gold tier. 

[00:21:36] SemiAnalysis found that gold-tier providers 
like Crusoe had a total cost of ownership that  

[00:21:41] was 5% to 15% lower than silver-tier ones, 
even when they had identical GPU pricing. 

[00:21:46] This makes sense because total cost of ownership 
is downstream of a bunch of different things that  

[00:21:50] don't necessarily show up in the sticker 
price, but that Crusoe has optimized. 

[00:21:54] Things like how well you detect faults 
and how quickly you replace failed nodes. 

[00:21:58] For example, Crusoe was one of the first clouds 
to adopt NVSentinel, NVIDIA's own GPU monitoring  

[00:22:04] and self-healing software for enhanced 
GPU uptime, utilization, and reliability. 

[00:22:09] This lets Crusoe make use of everything that 
NVIDIA has learned about why chips fail across all  

[00:22:14] their different fleets and deployments, so that 
Crusoe can catch faults earlier in the process. 

[00:22:18] And once they identify a failure, Crusoe can 
swap in a healthy node in less than 10 minutes. 

[00:22:23] Because they’re not running bare metal, Crusoe 
doesn't have to spend time installing an  

[00:22:27] operating system or configuring drivers.
They can just spin up a new VM on an  

[00:22:31] already running and pre-qualified host.
If you want to learn more about this or  

[00:22:34] the other reasons that Crusoe made 
gold tier, go to crusoe.ai/dwarkesh. 

[00:22:41] It may be helpful to just 
see what a mux looks like,  

[00:22:44] maybe a two-bit or a four-bit mux.
We’ll do a two-way mux. 

[00:22:53] We've got two different numbers, 
we’ve got these two inputs. 

[00:23:03] These are the inputs that are being selected 
between, and the selector can either be "I want  

[00:23:16] this one" or "I want the other one."
This is a one-hot encoding. 

[00:23:24] This is what we start with.
Let's focus on this case. 

[00:23:34] This is the actual input we got, and we 
want to produce this guy as the result. 

[00:23:42] Very laboriously, we AND 
this bit with all of these. 

[00:23:50] That produces ANDing this bit with this row.
Likewise, we AND this bit with this row. 

[00:23:55] That produces all 0s. There are four ANDs here.
Finally,  

[00:24:07] we OR these two together, and this gives a 1.
We OR these two together, this gives a 1. 

[00:24:09] We OR these two together, it gives a 0.
We OR these two together and it gives a 1. 

[00:24:15] Those are the four ORs.
This actually ends up  

[00:24:22] looking a little bit like addition.
We did exactly the same set of ANDs. 

[00:24:28] We've ANDed all of these things together, 
but then instead of collapsing it by using  

[00:24:34] full adder circuits, we just get a 
very simple collapsing with OR gates. 

[00:24:38] But that doesn't look like n times p.
This was with n=2 inputs. 

[00:24:48] In the general case, we will have n 
rows, and we'll have p bits per row. 

[00:25:03] That gives us the n times p many AND gates.
In this circuit I've described, almost all of  

[00:25:11] the cost, seven-eighths of the cost, is in reading 
and writing the register file, and only a tiny  

[00:25:19] fraction of the cost is in the logic unit itself.
This is the problem to solve. 

[00:25:24] This essentially was the state of play prior 
to the Volta generation of Nvidia GPUs. 

[00:25:31] This kind of thing is what 
was inside the CUDA cores. 

[00:25:37] This problem statement is what motivated 
the introduction of Tensor Cores,  

[00:25:41] which are more generically called systolic arrays.
Think about how we're going to solve this problem. 

[00:25:46] We're spending almost all of our 
circuit area on something that we  

[00:25:48] really don't care about and is hidden to the 
software programmer, and the thing that we  

[00:25:52] actually care about is not much of the area.
Make this one bigger somehow while keeping  

[00:25:57] this at the same size.
That's the goal. 

[00:26:01] The evolution was that we had baked 
this much into hardware at this stage. 

[00:26:06] This single line is a multiply-accumulate, 
and this single thing was baked into hardware. 

[00:26:11] The idea of a systolic array is to go 
two levels of loops up and bake this  

[00:26:17] entire loop out here into hardware.
The idea is that if we have a much  

[00:26:22] bigger granularity fixed-function 
piece of logic, maybe the taxes we  

[00:26:27] pay on the input and output are much smaller.
Interesting. It sounds like you're suggesting  

[00:26:30] that if you go up one step in the matrix 
multiply loop, you can tilt the balance  

[00:26:41] more towards compute than communication.
That's right. There are two effects we're  

[00:26:46] going to take advantage of here.
One is that we can do more stuff  

[00:26:49] per every trip through our register file.
The other is that in some of this loop, we can  

[00:26:58] take advantage of certain things staying fixed.
Visually, we're going to look at this  

[00:27:07] matrix multiplication.
This portion of the loop  

[00:27:09] corresponds to a matrix-vector multiplication.
We'll take a matrix and multiply it by a vector. 

[00:27:21] How do we do this?
Every column gets  

[00:27:23] multiplied by the vector and then summed.
We're going to sum along columns. 

[00:27:28] This 0 and 3 gets multiplied by the 3 and 
7 and gets summed, and then the 1 and 2  

[00:27:32] gets multiplied by the 3 and 7 and gets summed.
There is a multiply-accumulate associated with  

[00:27:38] every single one of these entries in the matrix.
We'll draw out these four multiply-accumulates. 

[00:27:53] Just to make sure I understand why there are 
four multiply-accumulates: each entry in the  

[00:28:01] column that corresponds to the output 
vector is a dot product, and in this  

[00:28:09] case it will be two multiplications and then 
the addition of those two multiplications. 

[00:28:16] You're accumulating...
Really there's only one addition per  

[00:28:20] dot product, but we like to start with zero.
But it includes the initialization of zero. 

[00:28:23] Yeah. We want to have quadratically more compute. 

[00:28:30] We have x times y as much 
compute as we had before. 

[00:28:41] But we want to aim for having only 
x times as much communication. 

[00:28:52] The intention is to get this 
advantage term going as y. 

[00:28:57] We've laid down the multiplications.
We want to bring in a vector of size two, and  

[00:29:06] that is already in line with our columns target.
That's fine. However, we need to manage the  

[00:29:11] communication of this matrix, 
which exceeds our budget of x. 

[00:29:18] The idea is that in an AI context, this matrix 
is going to stay fixed for a long period of time. 

[00:29:29] We've got some register files sitting over here.
The amount of stuff coming out of this register  

[00:29:36] file… this is the term that we 
want to go as x, in some sense. 

[00:29:43] We don't want to bring this full matrix 
in from the register file every cycle,  

[00:29:47] because that would cost too much in 
terms of wiring from the register file. 

[00:29:55] Our key trick is that this matrix can 
be stored locally to the systolic array. 

[00:30:04] We'll store these numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3 
in a gate called a register that physically  

[00:30:15] stores these numbers, and we're going to 
reuse these numbers over and over again  

[00:30:19] for a large number of different vectors.
The optimization here is that the nature of  

[00:30:23] matrix multiplication is that you can store this 
square quadratic thing directly where the logic is  

[00:30:35] happening, which has an extra dimension compared 
to the inputs that you keep swapping in and out. 

[00:30:45] That’s right.
This is the nature of  

[00:30:46] what a matrix multiplication is.
You do a lot of multiplication  

[00:30:52] to get one value out.
A dot product is the  

[00:30:55] result of a lot of multiplications.
So that optimization means you can  

[00:30:59] stuff a lot of multiplication in 
before you get some value out of it. 

[00:31:03] That's right. Just to complete the 
picture of concretely how that looks:  

[00:31:09] I swapped the 3 and the 2 here.
Just like this 0 and 3 is going  

[00:31:17] to multiply by the 3 and the 7, we're going 
to form a dot product along columns here. 

[00:31:26] We're going to feed a 3 and a 7 in here.
This feeds into this multiplication and also  

[00:31:35] feeds into this multiplication.
Likewise, the 3 feeds  

[00:31:39] into here and also into here.
Then we're going to sum along here. 

[00:31:49] Starting at the top of a column, we feed in 0s, 
and then coming out the bottom we get results. 

[00:31:55] Visually, there's a dot product performed along 
columns in a matrix, and that maps exactly to  

[00:32:03] what is done spatially in the systolic array.
This is one dot product summed vertically,  

[00:32:09] and this is a second dot 
product also summed vertically. 

[00:32:13] What is the data that needs to go 
into and out of the register file? 

[00:32:17] We have x amount of data coming 
out on the output, and we also  

[00:32:23] have x amount of data coming from the input.
With respect to the input and output vectors  

[00:32:33] at least, we've met our goal of having only x as 
much data going in and out of the register file. 

[00:32:44] This leaves open the question: I said the 
weight matrix is stored locally in the systolic  

[00:32:51] array, so how did it get there in the first place?
At some point, you need to boot your chip and  

[00:32:56] populate this data, so where did that come from?
The trick is that we just do it very slowly. 

[00:33:02] We very slowly trickle-feed 
it into the systolic array. 

[00:33:07] The simplest strategy is that we run 
this daisy chain: feed a number in here,  

[00:33:13] and on the next clock cycle it will move 
down to the next entry of the systolic array. 

[00:33:18] We can do that in every column in parallel, 
this is also going to come from here,  

[00:33:26] and that gives us another factor of 
approximately x units of bandwidth coming in. 

[00:33:32] Would you mind repeating 
that sentence one more time? 

[00:33:36] We know that we're going to be bringing 
numbers only rarely into the matrix. 

[00:33:43] We just want to come up with any construction 
at all such that the amount of wiring that  

[00:33:48] crosses the boundary of the systolic 
array is bounded to x and not go as xy. 

[00:33:56] A particularly simple strategy is that 
we bring a number into the top row of  

[00:34:03] the systolic array in one clock cycle.
Then, for y consecutive clock cycles,  

[00:34:11] we bring in the top row every time and 
shift all the other rows down by one. 

[00:34:16] This keeps the wiring that needs to 
come from this expensive register file  

[00:34:22] only down to a factor of x rather than xy.
I see. There are two questions in terms  

[00:34:27] of communication: communication 
time and communication bandwidth. 

[00:34:33] You're saying that since we're only going to be 
loading this in once, let's minimize bandwidth,  

[00:34:39] because bandwidth equals die area.
We load it in slowly over smaller  

[00:34:45] lanes because we're just going to 
keep this value in there for a while. 

[00:34:48] Exactly.
It's interesting to me that when we were talking  

[00:34:52] last time about inference across many chips, the 
big high-level thing we're trying to optimize for  

[00:34:58] is increasing the amount of compute per memory 
bandwidth, that is to say, per communication. 

[00:35:03] Here also, we're trying to increase 
the amount of actual multiplies  

[00:35:08] or additions relative to transporting 
information from registers to the logic. 

[00:35:16] In both cases, you're trying to maximize 
compute relative to communication. 

[00:35:20] This shows up all the way up and down the stack.
This is close to the bottom, to the gates. 

[00:35:28] There's a version that's maybe even closer 
to the gates in the precision of the number  

[00:35:34] format that you choose to use.
We saw that same effect. 

[00:35:39] There's a squared versus linear term going 
on both purely in the precision of the ALU,  

[00:35:47] but also in the size of the matrix.
This unit is the next bigger unit. 

[00:35:55] We had the multiplication circuit, and on top 
of that we have a pretty large systolic array. 

[00:36:01] I drew it as 2x2, but older TPUs were described 
as 128x128 of this circuit shown here. 

[00:36:12] This ends up being the most efficient known 
circuit for implementing a matrix multiply. 

[00:36:21] We've talked about how it seems 
obvious that you should try to  

[00:36:26] maximize compute relative to communication.
What are non-obvious trade-offs that  

[00:36:35] keep you up at night, about whether you should do 
X or Y and it's not obvious what the answer is? 

[00:36:41] Most of the decisions in chip 
design are sizing decisions. 

[00:36:48] Already in what we've drawn so far… AI 
chips all have this circuit in them. 

[00:36:56] They have a systolic array, and somewhere near 
it a register file providing inputs and outputs. 

[00:37:06] Even within this scope, the sizing questions you 
have are: how big should I make my systolic array,  

[00:37:11] and how big should I make the register file?
These two questions are coupled. 

[00:37:25] One way to think of it is to set a 
budget for what percentage of chip  

[00:37:32] area you want to spend on data movement.
Maybe I say that I want this to be 10%  

[00:37:36] and the systolic array to be 90%.
Then I can size my register file. 

[00:37:42] Bigger register files are more flexible.
They allow me to get more application-level  

[00:37:47] performance out, but they take away from 
the area spent on the systolic array. 

[00:37:55] I recently ran an essay contest where I asked 
people to write about what I consider to be some  

[00:37:59] of the biggest open questions about AI.
The submission window closed last week,  

[00:38:03] so I used Cursor to create a couple of different 
interfaces to help me review the entries. 

[00:38:07] One interface anonymizes submissions 
and hides the necessary information. 

[00:38:10] It lets me group responses by question, 
add notes, and record my scores. 

[00:38:14] The other interface helps me review 
entrants who also want to be considered  

[00:38:17] for the researcher role that I'm hiring for.
The UI puts the applicant's essay right next  

[00:38:21] to their resume and their personal website 
so that I can see everything at once. 

[00:38:25] Cursor's harness is really good at helping 
these models see and improve their UIs. 

[00:38:29] I watched it render these interfaces in 
the built-in browser, take screenshots,  

[00:38:33] click through sections, and keep iterating.
At this point,  

[00:38:36] Cursor is where I do most of my work.
Whether I'm reading and visualizing a bunch  

[00:38:40] of research papers, or coding up an interface to 
review applications, or making flashcards for my  

[00:38:45] blackboard lectures, Cursor just makes it very 
easy for an AI to look at whatever I'm looking at  

[00:38:50] and help me understand it and work with me on it.
So whatever you're working on,  

[00:38:54] you should do it in Cursor.
Go to cursor.com/dwarkesh. 

[00:39:00] Where does the clock cycle of a chip come in?
What determines what that is? 

[00:39:08] And what is a clock cycle of a chip?
At baseline, it's worth observing  

[00:39:12] that chips are incredibly parallel.
You've got 100 billion transistors in a chip. 

[00:39:16] A key thing you need to do whenever you 
have massive parallelism is synchronize  

[00:39:21] between the different parallel units.
In software, typically you have these very  

[00:39:27] expensive synchronization methods like a mutex.
One thread will finish what it's doing,  

[00:39:34] grab a lock stored somewhere in memory, 
and notify the other thread that it's done. 

[00:39:39] On chips, we take a very different approach.
Every nanosecond or so, all circuitry in the chip  

[00:39:50] will pause for a moment and synchronize.
That is the clock cycle. 

[00:39:58] The entire chip typically goes in lockstep 
to the next operation in one fell swoop. 

[00:40:06] What this looks like in circuitry is that 
the clock is mediated by registers, which  

[00:40:17] are these storage devices we've drawn elsewhere.
The way to think of it is: I have some storage  

[00:40:24] holding a bit, which might be 0 or 1.
Then I have some cloud of logic,  

[00:40:29] which maybe is this systolic array or multiplier.
I have a bunch of inputs feeding into this cloud  

[00:40:42] of logic, and eventually there's going to 
be some output register that it writes to. 

[00:40:48] There is a global clock signal 
driving all these registers. 

[00:40:57] At a certain instance in time, when the clock 
strikes, whatever value happens to be on that  

[00:41:05] wire at that instant is what gets stored.
The challenge is that I would like to have  

[00:41:15] my clock speed run as fast as possible.
If I run at two gigahertz, I get twice as  

[00:41:19] many operations done per second 
as if I run at one gigahertz. 

[00:41:24] But what that ends up meaning is that I'm very 
sensitive to the delay through this cloud of  

[00:41:30] logic, because any computation happening in there 
needs to finish before the next clock cycle hits. 

[00:41:40] A major point of optimization on any chip 
is to make this delay as short as possible. 

[00:41:53] Interesting. The constraint here seems 
to be that if you add too much logic,  

[00:42:02] you might risk missing the clock cycle.
But if you don't add enough, you're  

[00:42:07] leaving potential compute on the table.
Is there ever a situation where you take  

[00:42:15] a probabilistic chance that a computation 
finishes, or is it strictly that it either  

[00:42:23] finishes by the clock cycle or it doesn't?
In standard chip design, you margin it such  

[00:42:28] that there is a probability, but 
it's many standard deviations out. 

[00:42:34] For all intents and purposes, it is a 
reliable part and will always meet the clock. 

[00:42:40] There are some weird exceptions, like clock domain 
crossings where you go from one clock to another. 

[00:42:45] Then you actually do have to 
reason about this probability. 

[00:42:47] But in the main path, you margin it such that 
you'll get there 25% of the clock cycle in  

[00:42:55] advance, making it very unlikely that it misses.
Where the clocks synchronize, where the  

[00:43:07] registers are, is this something 
you determine as a chip designer? 

[00:43:11] Or is it an artifact where you want a certain 
sequence of logic, and the software you use to  

[00:43:18] convert your Verilog into what you send to 
TSMC just determines that to make it work,  

[00:43:25] you have to put a register here, here, and 
here, making sure no single step makes the  

[00:43:33] whole chip's clock cycle longer than it has to be?
Inserting them is actually a huge part of the  

[00:43:38] work of designing a chip.
It's done by a combination  

[00:43:42] of manual and automatic methods.
To show the very dumb version of  

[00:43:48] what you can do here, you can take 
this logic and split it in half. 

[00:43:53] Instead of just one cloud of logic, I can have two 
smaller clouds of logic that do the same thing,  

[00:44:02] but split them up by a register.
If you split it in the middle,  

[00:44:13] you can hit twice the clock frequency.
That's great, you get twice the performance,  

[00:44:17] but at the cost of an extra 
register, which means more storage. 

[00:44:22] Stepping back, why do we need 
to synchronize the whole chip? 

[00:44:25] If you imagine playing Factorio or 
something, there's no global clock cycle. 

[00:44:28] Things are just done when they're done.
There's iron on the plate, and you can  

[00:44:31] take it if you want.
Taking that analogy,  

[00:44:36] the thing you need to be mindful of is if I 
have two different paths through some logic. 

[00:44:41] Say I have to do computation 
f here and computation g here,  

[00:44:47] and they're going to meet for computation h.
There's going to be manufacturing variance. 

[00:44:59] In some chips f will take a little longer; 
in some chips g will take a little longer. 

[00:45:03] If I have a signal propagating through, and 
the results from f and g have to meet up at h,  

[00:45:12] what can go wrong is that f gets 
there early and it meets the previous  

[00:45:16] value of g, or the next value of g.
Ah. And h needs to know when to start,  

[00:45:21] when the next iteration has…
Exactly. 

[00:45:24] This explains why different chips made 
at the same process node, the same TSMC  

[00:45:32] technology, can have different clock cycles.
Two chips made at 3 nm might have different clock  

[00:45:38] cycles based on whether they were able to optimize 
to ensure no single critical path is so long that  

[00:45:48] it slows down the whole chip's clock cycle.
That's right. This optimization I showed here  

[00:45:53] is called pipeline register insertion.
We've inserted a register in the  

[00:45:59] middle of the pipeline.
This is a pure trade-off  

[00:46:02] between clock speed and area.
That is the easy case. 

[00:46:08] There is a harder case too.
I drew out a pipeline of logic,  

[00:46:14] but in other cases you may have some calculation 
which actually feeds back in on itself. 

[00:46:22] It runs some function f and 
then writes back to itself. 

[00:46:27] For example, this might be an addition where 
you're adding a number every clock cycle. 

[00:46:43] This little circuit essentially sums all the 
numbers presented on different clock cycles. 

[00:46:49] The challenge is, if this plus 
takes too long, what can I do? 

[00:46:54] If I try to put a pipeline register 
right in the middle of it, it  

[00:47:05] changes the computation that's done.
Instead of forming a running sum  

[00:47:08] of everything that comes in, I will 
actually have two different running sums. 

[00:47:12] I'll end up with a running sum of the even 
numbers and a running sum of the odd numbers. 

[00:47:18] This constraint—where I have a loop in my logic, 
which all chips have somewhere—is the hardest  

[00:47:25] thing to address and sets the clock cycle.
I don't understand why it would be  

[00:47:29] a problem to have that.
I'm not even sure what it  

[00:47:30] would mean to have a register there.
Is it a sort of atomic operation? 

[00:47:36] Well, plus is not really atomic.
As you just demonstrated. 

[00:47:41] It took a whole lot of work to do a summation.
You can take the early parts of that work,  

[00:47:45] stick a register in the middle, and 
then take the late parts of that work. 

[00:47:48] Okay. TSMC offers a PDK which 
specifies the primitives of  

[00:47:58] logic they can grant you in the chip.
It's up to them to determine that no  

[00:48:03] primitive is bigger than the clock cycle 
they're hoping a process node targets. 

[00:48:10] But other than that, can't you just take 
all the primitives from TSMC and keep adding  

[00:48:19] registers between them as much as needed 
until you get to your desired clock cycle? 

[00:48:24] As a logic designer, the chip 
architect sets the clock cycle. 

[00:48:28] For example, the primitives you get from TSMC 
are on the order of AND gates or full adders. 

[00:48:36] It depends a lot on voltage and which library you 
choose, but generally you can have about 10, 20,  

[00:48:46] or 30 of these sequentially in a clock cycle.
These primitives are very fast,  

[00:48:51] maybe 10 picoseconds.
As a logic designer, in principle,  

[00:48:57] if you just had a register and an AND gate in a 
loop, you could get an insanely fast clock speed,  

[00:49:07] more than four, five, or six gigahertz.
But if you take this really simple circuit  

[00:49:16] and look at the area you're spending 
here… This is called one gate equivalent  

[00:49:23] in size, so unit of one in area.
This thing is maybe a unit of eight in area. 

[00:49:31] Again, almost all your cost 
becomes synchronization or  

[00:49:34] communication cost compared to the actual logic.
This would be a case where you've gone too far. 

[00:49:40] You've made your clock speed really 
fast at the cost of spending almost  

[00:49:43] all of your area on pipeline registers.
Interesting. So you're hinting at a dynamic  

[00:49:50] where you can have a really fast clock speed 
but you're not getting that much work done. 

[00:49:56] You can have low latency but low throughput.
It hurts your throughput, in fact, because  

[00:50:05] the throughput of your chip is the product of 
how much you get done per clock cycle—which  

[00:50:11] is based on area efficiency—times 
how many clocks you get per second. 

[00:50:15] This is actually so similar to the thing we 
were discussing last time about batch size,  

[00:50:21] where if you have a low batch size, any one 
user can receive their next token really fast,  

[00:50:28] but the total number of tokens processed in, say, 
an hour will be lower than it could otherwise be. 

[00:50:34] Exactly. You get less parallelism out if 
you drive your clock speed up really high. 

[00:50:39] Language models are starting to compete 
against the best human forecasters. 

[00:50:42] I sat down with two senior Jane Streeters, Ron 
Minsky and Dan Pontecorvo, and asked: at some  

[00:50:48] point, does AI just do what Jane Street does?
There's a world that we should take seriously  

[00:50:52] where, you know, we're going to build large 
language models or some other AI systems that  

[00:50:56] are like strictly smarter than all humans on the 
planet and more capable at all cognitive tasks. 

[00:51:02] Trading in particular feels to me as like kind 
of AGI complete, sort of like NP complete,  

[00:51:08] because at the end of the day trading involves 
figuring out what things are worth, which means  

[00:51:15] making predictions about the future.
Jane Street isn't betting against AI. 

[00:51:18] They just signed a six 
billion dollar compute deal. 

[00:51:20] But Ron's view is that the edge keeps moving.
I have never been more desperate to hire more  

[00:51:25] engineers and more traders than I am today.
You know, you have the usual thing of like  

[00:51:29] the other hard parts that we 
don't yet know how to automate. 

[00:51:31] Well, that ends up being where 
the competitive edge lies. 

[00:51:34] You can find these open positions and watch 
the full interview at janestreet.com/dwarkesh. 

[00:51:41] I remember talking to an FPGA engineer at 
Jane Street, Clark, who helped me prep for  

[00:51:48] the previous interview we did together.
He was explaining why they use FPGAs. 

[00:51:55] I imagine that for high-frequency trading, 
throughput is less important than latency,  

[00:52:01] so having very specific control over the clock  

[00:52:03] cycle in a deterministic way 
is the most important thing. 

[00:52:08] Maybe it'd be interesting to talk about why 
you can't just achieve that with an ASIC,  

[00:52:14] or why you might use an FPGA to have deterministic 
clock cycles for high-frequency trading. 

[00:52:25] Let's consider the business 
case for an FPGA versus an ASIC. 

[00:52:31] FPGAs and ASICs use largely 
the same conceptual model. 

[00:52:36] You have a series of gates built from small 
primitives—ANDs, ORs, XORs—connected together  

[00:52:48] with wires running in a fixed clock cycle.
Anything you can express in an FPGA you  

[00:52:53] can express in an ASIC too.
It will be about an order of  

[00:52:55] magnitude cheaper and have better energy 
efficiency on an ASIC than an FPGA. 

[00:53:01] The trade-off is that the first FPGA costs you 
$10,000, whereas the first ASIC you make costs $30  

[00:53:08] million because it requires an entire tape-out.
The business use case for an FPGA is when you want  

[00:53:16] something that has very deterministic 
latency, fast runtime, and high parallelism,  

[00:53:25] but you are going to change the 
workload frequently, maybe every month. 

[00:53:29] You don't want to pay that 
tape-out cost every time. 

[00:53:34] How does an FPGA actually emulate the ASIC 
programming model in a fixed piece of hardware? 

[00:53:42] At its core, it has the two 
components we just talked about. 

[00:53:54] It has registers as storage 
devices, and it has lookup tables  

[00:54:03] (LUTs) which provide all of the gates.
Then there's a third component. 

[00:54:11] We have a swarm of these registers and LUTs, 
and they are connected by a big set of muxes. 

[00:54:30] In front of every single one of these, we have a 
mux which selects an input from everywhere else. 

[00:54:44] We have a whole bunch of different 
options feeding into all of these things. 

[00:54:54] What this allows is essentially that when 
I program my FPGA, I can take all of these  

[00:55:01] components and superimpose a particular wiring 
which goes through this LUT, feed it into another  

[00:55:10] LUT, send it to this register, and then feed 
it into another LUT, or something like that. 

[00:55:16] What I've drawn in orange is how you… 
FPGA means Field-Programmable Gate Array. 

[00:55:22] The orange is what has been programmed in 
the field, whereas the white is all the  

[00:55:26] wires that must exist in the FPGA in order to 
actually make the device in the first place. 

[00:55:30] What does it mean to be programmed in the field?
Programmed in the field means the device is  

[00:55:34] being deployed in a data center.
It's sitting out in the world,  

[00:55:36] and then you can come and program it.
Ah, not field as in like electric field. 

[00:55:39] Field as in like out there in the world, ok.
If I look at how the field programming comes  

[00:55:48] out of the first lookup table and goes 
into a second one, how does that work? 

[00:55:57] Where are the wires that make that happen?
I got a little bit lazy in drawing all of these. 

[00:56:03] Every single device here has a mux sitting in 
front of it, which can select from all of the  

[00:56:11] nearby circuits that are available.
The actual configuration of the  

[00:56:19] FPGA amounts to the mux control.
In this mux, we have the data inputs,  

[00:56:28] and we have the control that selects.
There's a little storage device sitting next  

[00:56:34] to every single one of these muxes saying, "This 
is where you're going to source your input from." 

[00:56:43] Programming it consists of configuring 
every single one of these muxes. 

[00:56:47] That makes sense. What is happening 
inside of the lookup table? 

[00:56:51] The lookup table is also going to have a 
little bit of control telling it what to do. 

[00:56:56] Its purpose is to configurably 
take the role of an AND gate,  

[00:57:03] OR gate, XOR, or any of those different things.
There are many ways you could consider doing that. 

[00:57:10] The way it's done in traditional 
FPGAs… A lookup table has four bits  

[00:57:25] of input and one bit of output.
How many different functions are  

[00:57:31] there from four bits to one bit?
There are 16 different functions. 

[00:57:37] You can tabulate this as 16 different numbers.
You've got a table of 0111001, 16 entries. 

[00:57:52] This table is stored in 
this blue configuration bit. 

[00:58:00] It views these four bits as binary, looks up the 
relevant row of the table, and emits that bit. 

[00:58:08] This is essentially a truth-table 
view of lookup tables. 

[00:58:11] Okay, so if you think about an AND gate, OR gate, 
NOR gate, XOR gate, these all take as input… 

[00:58:18] Those are two-input functions. Sometimes we have 
a three-input function, like a three-way XOR,  

[00:58:25] or a four-way XOR.
In this case,  

[00:58:27] does it just depend on how big it is?
The typical size for LUTs is four inputs. 

[00:58:32] It's sort of just a sweet spot.
There’s another compute vs. communication  

[00:58:37] trade-off here.
If it has too  

[00:58:39] few inputs, you need to use more LUTs.
Basically the lookup table is a truth table. 

[00:58:47] With a truth table, you can 
program in any gate you want. 

[00:58:50] So instead of a lookup table, you can 
just think of it as a programmable gate. 

[00:58:53] That's right. One of the things you can do 
here is you can see where the rule of thumb  

[00:58:59] that an FPGA is an order of magnitude 
more expensive than an ASIC comes from. 

[00:59:04] You count how many gates would 
be inside this lookup table. 

[00:59:10] We can view this lookup table 
essentially as one of these muxes. 

[00:59:14] It has to select between 16 different values,  

[00:59:19] so it's a mux with n=16 options and p=1 bits.
As we saw earlier, this circuit  

[00:59:37] costs n times p many gates.
So it costs np, which is 16,  

[00:59:45] AND gates, and also 16 ORs.
This circuit being the mux? 

[00:59:52] Exactly, the mux.
The mux that goes into the lookup table? 

[00:59:56] The lookup table itself you can think of 
as being a big mux that selects from all 16  

[01:00:02] rows down to one output.
That's the lookup table. 

[01:00:05] But the way you've drawn it here, 
there's a mux and then a lookup table. 

[01:00:08] It's muxes all the way down.
There is a second mux that is inside here. 

[01:00:12] This mux is this mux.
And the other mux is just saying… 

[01:00:18] where it came from in this mess of gates.
Right, and the second mux is, "Okay,  

[01:00:23] now you have one value, but that 
value is still a four-bit value." 

[01:00:29] Yeah, I've selected four bits from the soup.
Then I use those four bits to select which  

[01:00:35] entry in the lookup table I'm going to use.
Suppose in the first mux you're pulling  

[01:00:45] from eight nearby registers as input.
That's a total of 32 bits going in. 

[01:00:53] Out of that, four bits come out.
Those four bits go into the second mux,  

[01:00:58] which is inside the lookup table.
In this case, these registers  

[01:01:02] are single-bit registers.
If there are eight nearby  

[01:01:06] registers and lookup tables, then I 
have eight bits total coming in nearby. 

[01:01:11] I select from eight down to four different values.
There are actually four different muxes, a little  

[01:01:21] mux associated with each of these input bits.
Each of them is selecting one out of eight. 

[01:01:26] Where are those eight coming from?
Nearby registers and other LUTs. 

[01:01:30] Each register is one bit.
Yes. 

[01:01:33] I guess AMD or whoever makes these FPGAs 
still has to be opinionated about which  

[01:01:42] registers are connected to which registers.
You can program in the actual gates,  

[01:01:47] but they add a wire in the connect… 
the communication topology, right? 

[01:01:53] You get flexibility at a local grain.
There's a nearby neighborhood you can select from,  

[01:02:00] but for more coarse, long-distance 
connections, they form an opinion on that. 

[01:02:06] And the reason it's 10x slower is why?
If you look at the cost of building this  

[01:02:11] lookup table, it's 32 gates.
It can give me the equivalent  

[01:02:17] of—what’s an interesting thing I 
can do here—a four-way AND gate. 

[01:02:26] A four-way AND means AND, AND, 
and then an AND of an AND. 

[01:02:36] This is a circuit I could implement in 
an ASIC directly using three AND gates. 

[01:02:41] Using a LUT, I can also implement it, but 
it's going to take 32 gates instead of three. 

[01:02:47] So the overhead is really coming from 
the fact that there's a more concise  

[01:02:58] way to describe a truth table than listing out 
every single possible combination of inputs,  

[01:03:06] which is just to write out the gate.
Yes, to place down the polysilicon  

[01:03:11] and the wires and so on.
Interesting. One important point you  

[01:03:15] made to me is that the reason they prefer FPGAs to 
CPUs is that they get deterministic clock cycles. 

[01:03:21] They know when a packet will come in and go out.
Why isn't that a guarantee in CPUs? 

[01:03:28] You can actually design a CPU that 
has deterministic latency as well. 

[01:03:34] In fact, the processors inside a lot of 
AI chips also have deterministic latency. 

[01:03:40] Groq has advertised this. TPUs 
have that in the core as well. 

[01:03:46] The challenge is getting deterministic 
latency and high speed at the same time. 

[01:03:53] Non-deterministic latency comes from 
specific design choices in a CPU. 

[01:04:03] It's actually possible to remove those design 
choices and make a CPU with deterministic latency,  

[01:04:08] but those are not very attractive in the 
market, so people don't make those CPUs anymore. 

[01:04:16] In some sense, deterministic latency is a simpler 
starting point, and some chip designers have  

[01:04:24] added things in to make it non-deterministic.
To take a concrete example, probably the most  

[01:04:33] important source of non-determinism 
on a CPU is the CPU cache itself. 

[01:04:43] In a CPU, you have the CPU die itself, 
and then DDR memory off on the side. 

[01:04:54] You have a cache system inside that remembers 
recent accesses to DDR and stores them. 

[01:05:09] When I'm running through my 
CPU instructions, every time  

[01:05:12] I have an instruction that accesses memory, it 
first checks if the data was stored in the cache. 

[01:05:17] If not, it fetches it from DDR.
This is a huge optimization. 

[01:05:23] The cache is two orders of 
magnitude faster than the DDR. 

[01:05:27] If you never used the cache, basically all 
programs would run a hundred times slower. 

[01:05:34] The presence of a cache is absolutely necessary 
for a CPU to run at a reasonable speed. 

[01:05:39] But whether or not you get a cache hit 
depends on the ambient environment of the CPU:  

[01:05:45] what other programs are running, what has 
run recently, and what the random number  

[01:05:48] generator inside the cache system is doing.
That is a big source of non-determinism  

[01:05:53] in the runtime of a CPU.
That is the memory system for a CPU. 

[01:06:01] The big thing you can do differently 
is, instead of having the hardware say,  

[01:06:06] "I’m going to read memory" and then the 
hardware decides whether or not it comes  

[01:06:11] from the cache, you can bake this decision 
into software, a different design philosophy. 

[01:06:22] You see this in TPUs, for example.
I'll draw the same diagram,  

[01:06:28] but I'll call it a scratchpad.
The main difference is… This would be a TPU,  

[01:06:36] and you have HBM in this case rather than 
DDR, but it's still an off-chip memory. 

[01:06:43] Instead of the software saying "first access 
memory" and letting the hardware decide,  

[01:06:48] you have one kind of instruction that goes to 
the scratchpad and a totally different kind  

[01:06:53] of instruction that goes to HBM.
This style is generically known  

[01:06:58] as scratchpad instead of cache.
The key distinction is that you have  

[01:07:04] one kind of instruction that says "read or write 
scratchpad," and a totally different instruction  

[01:07:08] that says "read or write HBM."
So scratchpad being the cache. 

[01:07:12] Yeah, this thing here is the scratchpad.
Stepping way back: people say computers have the  

[01:07:22] "von Neumann architecture", where there's 
this serial processing of information. 

[01:07:28] Maybe it's just because we've 
been talking about parallel  

[01:07:30] accelerators, but the FPGA is super parallel.
The AI accelerators, the TPUs, are super parallel. 

[01:07:41] Even CPUs are super parallel if you 
think about all the cores they have. 

[01:07:46] In what sense is modern hardware 
actually the von Neumann architecture? 

[01:07:50] Is that actually a fair way 
to describe modern hardware? 

[01:07:52] I think it's a fair way to describe CPUs.
The amount of parallelism you get on a CPU is  

[01:07:58] about 100 cores times maybe 16-way vector 
units, so about 1,000-way parallelism on a CPU. 

[01:08:06] One question: there is a die being used for 
the CPU, and if there are fewer threads,  

[01:08:15] just as a matter of transistor voltages 
switching on and off, is it that there's  

[01:08:22] literally one control flow—a small part of the 
die—where voltages are switching on and off? 

[01:08:28] How do you actually occupy the die area of a CPU…
If there are so few cores, what are  

[01:08:35] you spending all of the die on?
Yeah, what is happening there? 

[01:08:37] The cores are just much 
bigger and more complicated. 

[01:08:44] We should compare a CPU core, which takes 
up one one-hundredth of the die, to a LUT. 

[01:08:50] A LUT is only 16 gates.
It's clear why there are so many  

[01:08:54] more LUTs in an FPGA than cores in a CPU.
But why are there more CUDA cores,  

[01:09:04] for example, than CPU cores?
What's the difference between a CPU and a GPU? 

[01:09:13] Inside the CPU, one big use 
of the area is the cache. 

[01:09:23] Very little is actually the ALUs.
Mostly it's these register  

[01:09:28] files rather than the logic units.
Both of those have equivalents in a GPU,  

[01:09:36] so that's not a big difference.
But the thing that does not have  

[01:09:39] an equivalent in a GPU is the branch predictor.
There is a whole big area in the CPU which is  

[01:09:49] just a bunch of predictors saying when the next 
branch will be and where the branch target is. 

[01:09:58] Stripping a lot of that out, as well 
as making these register files tighter,  

[01:10:06] drives a lot of the GPU gains over the CPU.
What is the purpose of the branch predictor? 

[01:10:10] To execute both branches at 
once, or what does it do? 

[01:10:13] The issue is that when I've got a series 
of instructions, if I have a branch,  

[01:10:27] the actual step of processing an 
instruction takes a really long time. 

[01:10:32] It takes maybe five nanoseconds.
The time to notice that I've got a branch,  

[01:10:43] evaluate whether the Boolean is true, update 
the program counter to the new target,  

[01:10:49] and then read from the instruction memory 
could take five nanoseconds to finish. 

[01:10:56] So in reality, this may 
finish somewhere down here. 

[01:11:03] I want to run a clock speed that is much 
faster than what five nanoseconds allows. 

[01:11:07] Five nanoseconds is a 200 MHz clock speed.
I would like to run at one or two gigahertz. 

[01:11:13] So I need to run other instructions 
while the branch is being evaluated. 

[01:11:21] I just want to keep running the 
instructions that happen after me. 

[01:11:27] But that might have been wrong.
If the branch ended up being taken, then  

[01:11:30] I need to know that instead of evaluating these 
instructions, I actually need to jump to wherever  

[01:11:34] the target is and run those instructions instead.
The purpose of the branch predictor is to predict,  

[01:11:42] five cycles earlier, that a branch is going to 
happen, before you even get to that instruction. 

[01:11:49] If I think about how the brain works 
versus what you're describing here,  

[01:11:52] at a high level the differences might be that 
while you can do structured sparsity in these  

[01:11:59] accelerators and save yourself some area that you 
would have otherwise had to dedicate to gates,  

[01:12:07] in the brain there's unstructured sparsity.
Any neuron can connect to any other neuron, and  

[01:12:12] not in ways where they have the column aligned.
Then there's the fact that memory  

[01:12:18] and compute are co-located.
Although I guess you could say in a way the memory  

[01:12:22] and compute are co-located on these dies too.
This is exactly the co-location,  

[01:12:25] in some sense, of the memory and compute.
So maybe that isn't a big difference. 

[01:12:30] Another big difference is that the clock cycle 
on the brain is much slower than on computers. 

[01:12:40] Partly that's to preserve energy, because the 
faster the clock cycle, the bigger the voltage  

[01:12:47] needs to be in order for the signal to settle 
and to identify what state a transistor is in. 

[01:12:54] That’s right.
I don't know if  

[01:12:56] you have any commentary on what the brain 
might be doing versus how these chips work. 

[01:13:06] Let's take the clock speed one first.
The clock speed is quite high on a  

[01:13:16] chip because that drives higher throughput.
When we compare a GPU running some workload,  

[01:13:26] it's running batch size 1,000.
Whereas the brain is not running  

[01:13:29] batch size 1,000, there's only one of me.
You could imagine saying, "Take a GPU and  

[01:13:35] instead of running at a gigahertz, run 
it at a megahertz," and that would start  

[01:13:39] to look a little more like the equivalent 
things you're talking about in the brain. 

[01:13:45] But in the way silicon works, that does not give 
you a 1,000x advantage in energy efficiency. 

[01:13:58] What it ends up looking like is you just 
run this circuit once to stabilization,  

[01:14:07] and then it will sit idle 
for a long period of time. 

[01:14:10] It doesn't consume a lot of 
energy while it's sitting  

[01:14:12] idle because most of the energy is consumed 
in toggling bits from zero to one and back. 

[01:14:22] Let's talk about the energy 
consumption of a circuit like this. 

[01:14:26] The way to think of a bit being stored is that 
you've deposited some charge in a capacitor  

[01:14:32] sitting somewhere in the chip implicitly.
It becomes charged when the bit becomes a one,  

[01:14:38] and then it becomes discharged 
when it next goes to a zero. 

[01:14:41] That cycle of charging the capacitor 
and then dumping that charge out  

[01:14:45] to ground is where the energy is consumed.
This is called the dynamic or switching power,  

[01:14:49] and it's most of the energy consumption of a chip.
There is some other energy consumption just  

[01:14:54] coming from the fact that insulators 
aren't perfect, but we'll discard that. 

[01:15:00] Most of the energy consumption comes from 
toggling from zero to one and back to zero. 

[01:15:08] If you run a chip much slower and you only 
clock it once every thousand clock cycles,  

[01:15:12] you will have 1,000 times fewer transitions.
It will be about 1,000 times  

[01:15:16] less energy consumption.
But it's not a substantial  

[01:15:20] advantage in energy efficiency.
Okay, so you described how a TPU  

[01:15:25] works at a high level.
What is the difference  

[01:15:29] at a high level between how a GPU and a TPU work?
There is a high-level organization principle that  

[01:15:37] is different, and then inside 
the cores things are different. 

[01:15:41] Looking at the high level, we'll 
take a GPU and a TPU and see what  

[01:15:50] the top-level block structure looks like.
If you think of this as the whole chip  

[01:15:55] in each case, the organization 
of the GPU is mostly a bunch of  

[01:16:03] almost-identical units, which are the SMs.
They've got an L2 memory in the middle,  

[01:16:12] and then a bunch more of these SMs on the bottom.
So there is a fairly regular grid of cores. 

[01:16:24] If we look at a TPU in comparison, you end 
up with much coarser-grained units of logic. 

[01:16:34] You end up with just a few matrix units, 
which are the big systolic arrays. 

[01:16:48] In the middle you've got some vector unit, and 
then you've got your matrix units at the bottom. 

[01:17:00] These matrix units with a vector unit in 
the middle make up the whole TPU chip. 

[01:17:06] You can think of scaling this thing 
down into a really tiny unit with a  

[01:17:10] smaller matrix unit and a smaller vector 
unit, and that is sort of what an SM is. 

[01:17:16] From a very high-level point of view, the GPU has 
a lot of tiny TPUs tiled across the whole chip. 

[01:17:24] Oh, interesting. You're suggesting the tensor 
core within a streaming SM is analogous to an MXU? 

[01:17:31] Yeah, it's all very similar.
I see. If you had more lack of structure,  

[01:17:38] having a bunch of tiny TPUs makes a lot of sense.
Whereas if you just have huge matrix  

[01:17:44] multiplications, you might want to avoid the 
cost of having individual SMs with their own  

[01:17:54] registers and warp schedulers.
Why not just make a huge thing  

[01:17:58] and amortize those costs across the whole thing?
This shows up in how large you can grow things. 

[01:18:04] We've seen this theme, especially with the 
systolic array, where a larger systolic  

[01:18:08] array amortizes the register file costs better.
This design allows you to have larger systolic  

[01:18:14] arrays, whereas the GPU design constrains 
you to having small units of everything. 

[01:18:21] There is a trade-off, however.
Because of this coarse-grained  

[01:18:29] separation of things, you need to move a lot of 
data from the vector unit to the matrix units,  

[01:18:37] through just two lines of perimeter here.
If you look at the equivalent thing  

[01:18:46] in a GPU, you've got vector units everywhere, and 
you can move data through many different lines. 

[01:18:55] The amount of data you can move between a 
vector unit and a matrix unit is actually  

[01:19:00] much higher in a GPU than in a TPU.
Instead of having to move all the data  

[01:19:08] through just two lines, you're moving 
it through 16 lines of wiring in a GPU. 

[01:19:16] Right. But also you might 
have to move across less area. 

[01:19:21] Which is an energy saving as well.
So if you can operate entirely within  

[01:19:27] an SM, the data movement is much smaller.
But the moment you want to operate across SMs,  

[01:19:33] it becomes more complicated and expensive.
So you don’t have to comment, but one might  

[01:19:37] expect that a thing MatX might try to do 
is get the GPU-like smaller structure of  

[01:19:45] systolic arrays surrounded by SRAM, but at the 
same time make it so that the things you need in  

[01:19:55] an SM to support the CUDA architecture—which 
take a bunch of space—you might discard. 

[01:20:05] We've talked publicly about something we 
call a splittable systolic array, which  

[01:20:09] in some sense you can think of as big systolic 
arrays that can be small systolic arrays too. 

[01:20:13] Cool. Okay, I think that's 
a good note to close on. 

[01:20:16] Reiner, thank you so much.
Thanks, Dwarkesh.
