[00:00:00] Today, I'm interviewing Reiner
Pope, who is the CEO of MatX,

[00:00:03] which is a new chip startup.

[00:00:04] Previously, he was doing TPU architecture
and many other things at Google.

[00:00:09] This is a very different format
from my usual interviews.

[00:00:10] This is going to be a blackboard lecture.

[00:00:12] We're going to get up in a second.

[00:00:13] We in fact built this whole new
studio with specifically this

[00:00:16] format in mind, so it's a pleasure
to get to inaugurate it with you.

[00:00:21] We're going to be talking
about model architecture, ML

[00:00:23] infra, and many other things.

[00:00:25] The reason I think it's an important
topic is because once you understand how

[00:00:29] training and inference work in a cluster,
a lot of things—about why AI is the way

[00:00:35] it is, why AI architectures are the way
they are, why API prices are the way they

[00:00:40] are, and fundamentally why AI progress
is the way it is—start making sense.

[00:00:45] You need to understand the details
to get there, and you need a

[00:00:47] blackboard to understand the details.

[00:00:48] Reiner, thank you so much for doing this.

[00:00:50] Very happy to be here.

[00:00:52] Full disclosure, I am an angel
investor in MatX, but that's

[00:00:56] unrelated to this podcast.

[00:00:56] Reiner, to kick us off
I'll ask this question.

[00:01:01] We have a couple of companies
like Claude and Codex and Cursor

[00:01:05] offering something like Fast Mode,
where for 6x the price, they'll

[00:01:09] stream you tokens at 2.5x the speed.

[00:01:12] Mechanically, I'm curious
what's going on here.

[00:01:14] Why is it the case that you can
pay more to get faster latency?

[00:01:18] Two, could you keep going?

[00:01:19] Could you pay 100x more and
somehow get much faster speeds?

[00:01:25] Three, could you go the other way?

[00:01:27] Could you have something like Claude
Code "Slow Mode", where if you are

[00:01:31] willing to wait for minutes on end,
you could get even cheaper prices?

[00:01:36] Maybe this will help motivate the analysis
that you'll be doing through the lecture.

[00:01:39] Great.

[00:01:40] To jump to the conclusion a little
bit, the big effect is batch size.

[00:01:44] What we're going to do now is quantify
exactly what that looks like and what

[00:01:47] its implications are on latency and cost.

[00:01:50] There's another effect, which
you can call speculative decoding

[00:01:53] or multi-token prediction.

[00:01:55] We can maybe come back to that
later, but the first thing that

[00:01:58] we'll talk through is batch size.

[00:02:00] What I'd like to introduce is
the two principles of analysis.

[00:02:04] First, we're going to look at a
roofline analysis of how we run a

[00:02:07] transformer model on a cluster of chips.

[00:02:10] We'll take a

[00:02:13] Blackwell NVL72 cluster,
so a rack of 72 GPUs.

[00:02:19] The roofline analysis means we look at
memory bandwidth and compute performance.

[00:02:25] The other side of that is that we're
going to look at just two simple

[00:02:27] factors of the model: the time to
operate on the weights, and the time to

[00:02:32] operate on the context, the KV cache.

[00:02:36] Let's jump in.

[00:02:37] We're going to try and estimate
the time that it takes to run

[00:02:42] an inference of a certain shape.

[00:02:45] We're not perfect here.

[00:02:46] We can't exactly predict the time, so
instead we're going to approximate.

[00:02:50] We're going to say that the
time must be greater than or

[00:02:52] equal to a certain quantity.

[00:02:55] We're going to consider two different
aspects: the time it takes to

[00:03:01] do the memory fetches, and the
time it takes to do the compute.

[00:03:07] It will turn out that this
gives us very strong predictive

[00:03:09] power, even with a simple model.

[00:03:12] One by one, what is the time
that it takes to do the compute?

[00:03:19] There are really two things
I need to do in the compute.

[00:03:21] I need to multiply by all of the
active parameters, and then I need

[00:03:25] to do some work on the attention.

[00:03:28] Multiplying by all the active parameters,
I have a certain batch size that

[00:03:30] I'm running, and I've got a number
of active parameters in my model.

[00:03:38] Then I'm just going to divide
this by the compute throughput,

[00:03:41] which is the FLOPs of the chip.

[00:03:45] This is a hardware concern.

[00:03:48] This accounts for all of the compute time
for all of the weight matrix multiplies.

[00:03:54] There's a little caveat here.

[00:03:56] We've ignored the time to do any of the
attention computation, but that in general

[00:04:00] will be quite small in comparison to this.

[00:04:02] So we'll ignore this.

[00:04:03] I'll just interrupt from time to
time to ask some very naive questions

[00:04:05] or to clarify some basic points.

[00:04:09] For the audience, you're not
serving one user at a time.

[00:04:11] The batch refers to the fact that you're
serving many different users at the

[00:04:14] same time, and that's a whole batch.

[00:04:17] I can motivate the batch
at least a little bit.

[00:04:20] We will see exactly why batch is
such a favorable optimization.

[00:04:23] What will turn out to be the case is
that if you do not batch together many

[00:04:28] users, the cost and the economics you
get can be a thousand times worse than

[00:04:34] if you do batch many users together.

[00:04:36] We'll be able to see
that quite explicitly.

[00:04:38] Then, number of active parameters.

[00:04:40] If I look at, for example, a DeepSeek
model, the DeepSeek V3 model has

[00:04:44] about 37 billion active parameters,
and 700 billion total parameters.

[00:04:52] We're focusing on just the ones that
are active for a single AI token.

[00:04:56] We're modeling compute performance.

[00:04:58] I'm going to keep writing equals, but in
all of these cases, you can think of this

[00:05:00] time as being at least this much, and
maybe there will be some terms we ignored.

[00:05:05] On the memory side, what do
we need to do with memory?

[00:05:09] We need to fetch all of the weights,
so there is some time to fetch

[00:05:16] the total number of parameters,
not just the active parameters.

[00:05:21] There's weight fetch time, and then in
addition, there's a KV cache fetch time.

[00:05:27] This actually depends on batch size.

[00:05:30] For every element of the batch,
we have to fetch an entire context

[00:05:36] length worth of tokens, and
there's a size per token, bytes

[00:05:44] for one token.

[00:05:46] This is a model parameter.

[00:05:47] Maybe just backing up, let's explain
what the KV cache is real quick.

[00:05:52] When I do a forward pass… Let me draw
how the autoregressive inference works.

[00:05:58] This is during decode.

[00:06:01] If I have a bunch of text tokens… I'm
drawing a tensor because ultimately

[00:06:06] the tokens are represented as

[00:06:09] a tensor in some embedding dimension.

[00:06:12] In this direction, I
have the sequence length.

[00:06:18] The work of running a decode is that
I have to run each token through

[00:06:22] a whole bunch of matrix multiplies
over a bunch of different layers.

[00:06:29] In general, I'm going to have to do
that work over all of these tokens.

[00:06:35] But one step of decode is to produce
just this one additional token up here.

[00:06:42] What I'm going to do there is run a full
forward pass of multiplying by all of

[00:06:47] the weight matrices in the entire model.

[00:06:50] But then I've got this attention
mechanism where this token is looking

[00:06:55] at all of the past tokens, and
what is it looking at specifically?

[00:07:01] It is looking at some internal
representation that the model

[00:07:03] has produced of the tokens,
and we call that the KV cache.

[00:07:08] This process of this single
token attending to all of the

[00:07:11] history of tokens is attention.

[00:07:13] It is mostly dominated by memory
fetches rather than matrix multiplies.

[00:07:19] So we've got the amount of memory
that we're fetching shown over here,

[00:07:23] and then this is of course just
divided by the memory bandwidth,

[00:07:27] so the memory bytes per second.

[00:07:35] In fact, these equations here are enough
for us to now draw some fit lines.

[00:07:41] The things that we'd like to look at
are sensitivity to batch, and then also,

[00:07:46] which we'll draw separately, to context

[00:07:51] length.

[00:07:52] We said that the big effect you
can get is some trade-off in

[00:07:55] latency versus cost in batch size.

[00:07:58] Let's draw them out.

[00:08:00] I think there are just really
two graphs that we want to draw.

[00:08:02] We'll first draw batch
size versus time here.

[00:08:11] When we look at the shape of
this, we've got a maximum of

[00:08:15] the sum and then another term.

[00:08:19] Let's look at these terms one by one
and how they scale: the time for compute

[00:08:24] and memory, and how they show up.

[00:08:27] Let's first look at this compute time.

[00:08:31] This is just purely linear in
batch size with no offset, so

[00:08:35] it is some curve like this.

[00:08:37] This is t compute.

[00:08:44] On the memory side, we've got some
portion here that is just this constant

[00:08:51] in some base offset here,
which is the weight fetch.

[00:09:00] Finally, we have this term here,
which is the KV fetch, which is pretty

[00:09:14] linear in batch size, and
so it looks like that.

[00:09:17] The sum of this plus this maxed with
this… Let's at least first draw the sum.

[00:09:29] The two memory times in conjunction end
up looking on this curved slope like this.

[00:09:35] Then the overall maximum is—I'll
draw a little thicker here—the

[00:09:41] maximum of these two curves.

[00:09:44] What does this mean?

[00:09:47] This is a latency plot.

[00:09:54] If I grow my batch size, initially I
get some not very strong dependence

[00:09:59] on batch size, so there is some
lower bound on latency here.

[00:10:11] This already partially
answers the question.

[00:10:13] For a given hardware configuration—and
we can talk about varying the hardware

[00:10:18] configuration—there is a
lower bound on latency.

[00:10:20] It is simply that I need to
read all of my total parameters

[00:10:27] from memory into the chips, and
that takes a certain amount of time.

[00:10:31] If I use all of my memory bandwidth,
I can't do any better than that.

[00:10:34] It seems like the way you've drawn
the slopes for compute time and how

[00:10:40] the KV grows—and what implication
the KV has on memory time—

[00:10:42] What if

[00:10:48] this were above or below?

[00:10:49] Yeah, is that necessarily the case?

[00:10:52] If this is always true, then as
batch size grows compute always

[00:10:56] dominates KV, which suggests that
if you have a big enough batch size,

[00:11:00] maybe memory is never an issue.

[00:11:02] This is really sensitive to the
context length, so I think we

[00:11:05] should come back and explore this.

[00:11:08] As you vary the context length, the
KV fetch time will go up and up, and

[00:11:11] that will cause a transition from
compute-limited to memory-limited.

[00:11:15] Is there something especially
significant about the slope being

[00:11:19] exactly the slope of the compute time?

[00:11:25] Whenever we have balance points, it says
that you're getting it exactly right.

[00:11:29] For the particular context length
where the slopes match, that says I am

[00:11:34] equally memory-bound and compute-bound,
which is a really desirable place to

[00:11:39] be.

[00:11:40] This is a very simple algebra problem,
but suppose the optimal is 100K context

[00:11:48] length, and you go to 200K context length.

[00:11:52] Does your MFU go down to 50%?

[00:11:54] Does it have a humongous impact on MFU
to be slightly outside of the optimal

[00:11:58] context length range, the Goldilocks zone?

[00:12:01] That's right.

[00:12:02] That is true as modeled here.

[00:12:04] There is a key point here that

[00:12:08] I'm modeling the memory fetch
as linear in context length.

[00:12:11] That depends on model architecture.

[00:12:13] It is true for all of the model
architectures with dense attention.

[00:12:20] Sparse attention actually
scales much better than that.

[00:12:22] Got it.

[00:12:23] Is sparse attention what
everybody uses in practice?

[00:12:25] I'm pretty excited about sparse attention.

[00:12:27] It's hard to know what the labs are using.

[00:12:29] DeepSeek has published a
sparse attention mechanism.

[00:12:31] I'll just put a plug in that some
of the DeepSeek papers that have

[00:12:36] published sparse attention end up
putting a square root in this term.

[00:12:40] So far, we've looked at the latency.

[00:12:42] It's hard to read off cost from this.

[00:12:45] If I think about what cost means…

[00:12:49] To run this inference, I'm going to use
the GPU for a certain number of seconds,

[00:12:52] like one millisecond or 20 milliseconds.

[00:12:56] I have to pay the rental
time for that time.

[00:12:59] So it's $2/hour per GPU
or something like that.

[00:13:05] That's the cost of this inference,
but how many tokens have I

[00:13:08] processed during that inference?

[00:13:10] That is the batch size.

[00:13:12] What we actually want to plot is
the cost versus batch size, which

[00:13:18] is t over B versus batch size.

[00:13:23] This is the cost per token.

[00:13:30] We have to imagine dividing each
of these three curves by B, so

[00:13:34] multiplying by this reciprocal.

[00:13:38] What we end up with there
is… The compute curve

[00:13:44] was linear.

[00:13:44] We divide by B, and that
makes it a constant here.

[00:13:48] This is t compute.

[00:13:52] The KV fetch was linear, and now
it becomes a constant as well.

[00:14:00] Then the weight fetch

[00:14:10] was constant, and now we've
divided by B, so it becomes this

[00:14:22] parabola.

[00:14:22] Again, we're going to
compute the max of the sum.

[00:14:28] The sum of these two terms
shifts the parabola up.

[00:14:33] The sum of the KV fetch and
the weight fetch gives us

[00:14:39] a higher parabola that's like this.

[00:14:41] Then we're going to take
the max with the compute

[00:14:45] here.

[00:14:45] We end up with this being the
overall shape that we care about.

[00:14:52] Again, we see some limiting behavior.

[00:14:54] The cost initially starts very
high at a batch size of one.

[00:14:59] It almost goes to infinity because we've
got so many weight fetches that are

[00:15:04] not amortized over a large batch size.

[00:15:07] But as we increase the batch size, the
weight fetches become amortized over so

[00:15:11] many different batch elements that their
cost grows very small, and eventually the

[00:15:15] compute time ends up driving the cost.

[00:15:18] So there is a limiting

[00:15:23] lower bound on cost,

[00:15:29] which is this line here.

[00:15:31] So Claude Code Slow or Codex Slow or
whatever would just live on this line.

[00:15:35] It wouldn't help much because
you're not able to amortize the KV

[00:15:40] values over a much bigger batch.

[00:15:44] They're unique per batch.

[00:15:45] The compute is also unique per batch.

[00:15:46] So what is the minimum work
you can do per batch after

[00:15:49] amortizing everything else away?

[00:15:52] This point where you are no longer
memory bandwidth bound, practically

[00:16:00] how big a batch do you need?

[00:16:04] How big are the batches
practically for frontier models?

[00:16:07] You can just solve for that.

[00:16:09] It's not even particularly
sensitive to model architecture.

[00:16:13] Let's go ahead and do that.

[00:16:15] What we're talking about is when the
memory time is equal to the compute time.

[00:16:19] That’s what that question is.

[00:16:26] Because we're focused on what the batch
size is—and really there's a question

[00:16:30] of when the weights are amortized
over the multiplies—I'm going to

[00:16:34] focus on comparing the weight fetch
time to the weight multiply time.

[00:16:38] I'm going to disregard the KV fetch
term just to simplify the analysis

[00:16:43] so we can get a clean answer out.

[00:16:46] We're going to equate

[00:16:50] this portion with these two times.

[00:16:58] Writing that out, we get N,
number of total parameters,

[00:17:04] over memory bandwidth,

[00:17:09] is equal to

[00:17:12] batch size times number
of active parameters

[00:17:17] divided by the compute performance.

[00:17:22] Looking over here, everything
on the top are model parameters.

[00:17:26] Everything on the bottom
are hardware parameters.

[00:17:28] It turns out to be nice to
rearrange them such that we have

[00:17:31] the hardware parameters on one side.

[00:17:33] This is equivalent to

[00:17:40] FLOPs over memory bandwidth

[00:17:44] being equal to batch size times
number of active parameters,

[00:17:52] divided by the number of total parameters.

[00:17:56] This hardware

[00:17:59] parameter ends up being
a dimensionless constant.

[00:18:01] If you look in terms of FLOPs…
What are the dimensions of this?

[00:18:04] This is multiplies per second.

[00:18:06] This is bytes per second.

[00:18:07] So that's not quite dimensionless.

[00:18:09] But what you do is you say, how
many FP4 multiplies per second times

[00:18:20] the fact that each FP4 is half a byte.

[00:18:24] I can actually make this
end up being dimensionless.

[00:18:25] On most GPUs, this ends up being

[00:18:32] somewhere around 300.

[00:18:37] Has that ratio changed over
time as we've gone from model

[00:18:39] generation to model generation,
where the FLOPs keep increasing?

[00:18:41] This is a hardware parameter.

[00:18:43] To what extent has the hardware changed?

[00:18:46] From A100 to H100 to B100, the
FLOPs have increased substantially,

[00:18:51] the memory bandwidth has also
increased substantially, and it

[00:18:53] has remained reasonably stable.

[00:18:56] We can express this one as well.

[00:18:57] This is a sparsity parameter.

[00:19:00] I might even phrase this
slightly differently.

[00:19:01] Let's solve for batch size in total.

[00:19:05] Moving this back over to the other
side, we end up with batch size needs

[00:19:09] to be bigger than approximately 300

[00:19:13] times sparsity.

[00:19:16] For example, in DeepSeek I activate 32

[00:19:21] out of 256 experts, so this
would be 8 for DeepSeek.

[00:19:27] This actually gives you a ballpark which
is remarkably accurate to practice.

[00:19:31] Generally, people will go a
little bit larger than this.

[00:19:33] They don't really want to be
exactly at the balance point because

[00:19:37] real-world efficiencies aren't as
good as a roofline analysis would say.

[00:19:41] But take this and maybe
double or triple it.

[00:19:44] Okay, so it's two to three
thousand tokens per batch.

[00:19:49] But then if you included the KV
cache, the implication would be

[00:19:55] that the optimal batch size...

[00:19:57] Should grow larger.

[00:20:00] We solved for the equivalence between
when compute time is equal to memory time.

[00:20:06] If I add in something that consumes
more memory bandwidth, then I have

[00:20:10] less available for the weight loads.

[00:20:13] I need to grow the memory bandwidth
more, and therefore the batch size more.

[00:20:17] This seems incredibly small.

[00:20:19] This would be less than
one sequence, right?

[00:20:24] Keep in mind that I'm talking
about the number of tokens that

[00:20:27] I'm generating one more token for.

[00:20:30] It's actually 2,000 unique sequences.

[00:20:33] Got it.

[00:20:33] We're just talking about a single
forward pass on these sequences.

[00:20:39] You think of the batch as
the number of sequences.

[00:20:41] That’s right.

[00:20:43] When I'm prepping for interviews, I
often talk to experts in the field.

[00:20:45] So for Reiner, I chatted with two of
Jane Street's engineers, Clark and Axel.

[00:20:50] Clark, who works on low latency trading
systems, walked me through why Jane

[00:20:53] Street uses FPGAs to make sure that they
have predictable nanosecond latencies.

[00:20:57] “You can just build these like giant
grids of compute very easily that do

[00:21:01] exactly what you need that touch a
hundred megabytes of SRAM and then

[00:21:04] get your response back in tens of
nanoseconds very easily. And that's

[00:21:08] basically impossible on a CPU.”

[00:21:09] He then went on to explain why CPUs just
wouldn't work for this kind of thing.

[00:21:13] “And so if you have a clock that's going
every three nanoseconds, you actually

[00:21:16] have several bytes of information
at a time to make your decision.

[00:21:21] That's as opposed to a CPU where you'll
just collect up a whole packet, you

[00:21:24] know, let's say a 1500-byte packet, and
then you say, okay, this packet's ready.

[00:21:26] Here you go, CPU.

[00:21:27] You can start thinking about it now.”

[00:21:29] FPGAs allow you to react to the earliest
part of the packet as it arrives, rather

[00:21:33] than having to wait for the full thing.

[00:21:34] We also talked about liquid cooling,
network design, and many other things.

[00:21:37] If you're interested in this
stuff, Jane Street is hiring.

[00:21:40] You can check out their open
roles at JaneStreet.com/Dwarkesh.

[00:21:46] And if you want to watch the full prep
conversation, we posted it there too.

[00:21:49] If you've got a frontier model and you are
actually doing inference, surely they must

[00:21:56] have more than 2,000 concurrent users.

[00:21:58] Is there any added latency
from the fact that you need to

[00:22:01] have the whole batch fill up?

[00:22:02] Or if you have a reasonable amount
of users, is it so unlikely that

[00:22:08] it would take you 100 milliseconds
to fill up the next 2,000 slots?

[00:22:13] The way to think about this is: when
does the train depart, as a model?

[00:22:18] Let's say I've picked a batch
size that I'm going to run at.

[00:22:25] By the way, this intersection point
is the same intersection point here.

[00:22:30] I pick this batch size, and I
know that it's going to take, for

[00:22:32] example, 20 milliseconds, which is
a common place this ends up landing.

[00:22:36] This is a timeline of what

[00:22:42] is running on the GPU.

[00:22:43] It's going to start a new batch
every 20 milliseconds regardless.

[00:22:56] You can think of this as
a schedule for the train.

[00:22:58] A new train departs every 20 milliseconds.

[00:23:00] Any passengers who are
ready board the train.

[00:23:02] If the train is full, they
wait until the next train.

[00:23:05] If the train is not full, the
train is going to go anyway.

[00:23:07] In terms of what that means for queuing
latency, the worst case is that a request

[00:23:15] arrives just after the train departed.

[00:23:17] It has to wait for the next train, so
that's up to 20 milliseconds, and then it

[00:23:21] has to wait for that train to complete.

[00:23:25] So the worst-case latency
is 40 milliseconds.

[00:23:27] How is the 20 milliseconds derived?

[00:23:28] It's a rule of thumb, but where it
comes from is not fully explained yet.

[00:23:36] So far we've focused on memory
bandwidth and compute time.

[00:23:40] When we look at memory, the other
consideration is that we want to use

[00:23:43] all of the memory capacity we have.

[00:23:47] Generally, we're going to use
all of that memory capacity to

[00:23:50] store the weights or the KVs.

[00:23:55] In the time of doing a forward
pass, we want to read all of the

[00:23:58] memory capacity into the chip.

[00:24:01] That is capacity divided by bandwidth.

[00:24:03] That tends to be 20 milliseconds on
many different generations of HBM.

[00:24:07] The units make sense.

[00:24:08] You would have

[00:24:11] a byte divided by bytes per second.

[00:24:13] For example, on the Rubin generation,
it is something like 288 gigabytes

[00:24:18] divided by 20 terabytes per second.

[00:24:22] This

[00:24:28] comes out to about 15

[00:24:32] milliseconds.

[00:24:33] Let me make sure I understand
what this is saying.

[00:24:36] I understand the unit analysis.

[00:24:38] What it's saying is

[00:24:43] we can evacuate and replace
the HBM in this amount of time.

[00:24:50] So we don't want to be in a situation
where the HBM is not big enough that we're

[00:24:56] not actually able to write everything we
want to it or take everything out of it.

[00:25:02] Or we don't want to be in a situation
where our ability to write back

[00:25:05] and forth is so small compared...

[00:25:08] There are sort of two scenarios.

[00:25:09] Why don't we pick a latency that
is bigger than 15 milliseconds?

[00:25:14] If I think about what that
means, it means I actually have

[00:25:16] time to read the HBM twice.

[00:25:19] By the way, most HBM accesses
are reads, not writes.

[00:25:21] It's almost all reads because the
weight matrices are read-only, and

[00:25:25] almost all of the KV cache accesses

[00:25:30] are reads.

[00:25:30] In around 30 milliseconds,
I can read all of HBM twice,

[00:25:32] but what's the point of that?

[00:25:35] I don't want to read the
weight matrices twice.

[00:25:37] I don't want to read the KVs twice.

[00:25:38] Makes a ton of sense.

[00:25:40] A couple of quick questions.

[00:25:43] If it is the case that the optimal
batch size is something like 2,000,

[00:25:49] it's totally dependent on the
sparsity, not dependent on

[00:25:51] the model size or anything.

[00:25:52] Sparsity shows up in model size,
but beyond that, it only depends

[00:25:55] on sparsity, not on scale.

[00:25:57] That's a very interesting result.

[00:26:02] One question is how much of a push
towards centralization is it that

[00:26:07] you would have these economies of
scale from inference for batching?

[00:26:10] But it seems like it's
not that big a deal.

[00:26:13] Is 2,000 users at the same time a lot?

[00:26:14] It doesn't seem like a lot.

[00:26:15] We can do a bit of analysis on this.

[00:26:18] You can think of it in terms of number of
users, but a more productive way to think

[00:26:21] of it is in terms of tokens per second.

[00:26:25] What does this batch size
mean in terms of tokens

[00:26:30] per second of the system?

[00:26:32] Tokens per second is going to
be equal to the batch size.

[00:26:34] We run a batch of tokens, and we do that

[00:26:40] every time interval, which is

[00:26:44] equal to the 15-millisecond
or 20-millisecond number.

[00:26:48] This ends up being batch
size times about 60, so 64

[00:26:56] x B.

[00:26:58] This ends up being around 2,000 x
64, so 128,000 tokens per second.

[00:27:09] This is in more digestible units.

[00:27:11] It's hard to reason about
concurrent users, but what is

[00:27:14] the global traffic for a system?

[00:27:20] When you look at some of the
announcements, sometimes the

[00:27:23] API providers will brag about
how much traffic they have.

[00:27:28] The numbers I remember from some
announcements of Gemini last year

[00:27:31] were in the hundreds of millions
of tokens per second worldwide.

[00:27:34] This

[00:27:37] is one-thousandth of that.

[00:27:40] Gemini is big.

[00:27:42] One-thousandth of Gemini is a lot.

[00:27:44] To actually be competitive at scale,
you need to be able to serve at

[00:27:49] least one-thousandth of Gemini.

[00:27:50] That's interesting.

[00:27:57] The more sparsity you have,
the less compute you need.

[00:28:04] It does seem that as batch sizes get
bigger, compute ends up being the

[00:28:09] bottleneck, according to this analysis.

[00:28:11] Then the question is, how
far can you take sparsity?

[00:28:14] As the sparsity ratio increases, as you
have fewer active parameters relative

[00:28:19] to total parameters, how much is the
performance of the model degrading?

[00:28:23] Is it degrading faster than you're saving
compute by increasing the sparsity factor?

[00:28:31] You mean the quality of the model,
rather than the speed of the model.

[00:28:36] Unfortunately, we're not able
to answer that analytically.

[00:28:40] That is an empirical
question of model quality.

[00:28:43] The best I can do is pull up a
paper and answer that empirically.

[00:28:46] Should

[00:28:50] we pull up the paper now?

[00:28:50] This paper is "Unified Scaling
Laws for Routed Language Models."

[00:28:53] It's a somewhat old paper by this
stage, but one of the things they looked

[00:28:57] at is if I keep increasing sparsity,
what is the model quality impact?

[00:29:01] This answer is very sensitive to the
actual choice of mixture of experts.

[00:29:05] Mixture of experts has been around for a
really long time, maybe even back in 2017,

[00:29:11] but the techniques have changed a lot.

[00:29:13] DeepSeek's mixture of experts was
a big change in how it worked.

[00:29:17] There have been older papers, like
"GShard" and "Switch Transformer".

[00:29:21] The actual empirical results are
going to depend on all of that.

[00:29:24] On one of the older techniques shown
here, you can see if I hold constant

[00:29:29] the number of active parameters at
a certain size, and then I increase

[00:29:32] the sparsity, which they call expert
count, the quality keeps increasing.

[00:29:37] If you imagine drawing a horizontal
line from 1.3B dense across, you end up

[00:29:43] seeing that, in this case, the 64-expert
370-million activated parameter model

[00:29:49] is as good as a dense 1.3-billion model.

[00:29:52] So in some sense, it's actually
not amazing returns where you need

[00:29:55] to increase total parameters a
hundredfold to get the equivalent

[00:30:00] of 10x as many active parameters.

[00:30:04] Actually even more so.

[00:30:05] It's a huge increase in parameter count
for a modest increase in efficiency.

[00:30:10] So in this case, actually it's 4x?

[00:30:11] 64x for 4x.

[00:30:13] So while it is true that you get this
benefit of being able to economize

[00:30:24] on your compute time if you increase
sparsity, naively it would seem

[00:30:29] like a trade-off worth making.

[00:30:32] But if you're decreasing

[00:30:35] this by 2x and then having this go up
by 8x every time you double sparsity...

[00:30:42] Is that good or bad, actually?

[00:30:44] Even from a memory point of view…
Keep in mind you are doubling this

[00:30:48] portion of the memory fetches,
which is amortized by batch.

[00:30:52] So just keep running a larger batch size.

[00:30:56] From the point of view of the analysis
we've done here, this is a pure win.

[00:31:00] Keep doing it until you run out
of available users, basically.

[00:31:08] There's

[00:31:12] this equivalence where if I have a lot of
users, I can go to a much sparser model.

[00:31:16] From that point of view,
it's a reasonable trade-off.

[00:31:18] The other trade-off that shows up here
is that it also consumes memory capacity.

[00:31:23] We've only reasoned about
memory bandwidth here, but it

[00:31:25] also consumes memory capacity.

[00:31:26] I see.

[00:31:27] Let me make sure I understood.

[00:31:29] You're saying we want

[00:31:35] to spend less time computing,
therefore we do more sparsity.

[00:31:40] To make that work, we
need bigger batch sizes.

[00:31:42] Which means we need more memory capacity

[00:31:48] to have more sparsity.

[00:31:49] Maybe this would be a good point to talk
about how a mixture of experts layer is

[00:31:54] typically laid out on a rack of GPUs.

[00:31:58] Cool.

[00:31:58] Makes sense.

[00:32:00] Where were we?

[00:32:01] Sparse mixture of experts.

[00:32:03] Maybe how we lay that out on a GPU.

[00:32:08] Let's zoom in on the mixture of experts
layer first and draw what that looks like.

[00:32:15] Typically, we'll have some kind of
a router layer, which is making the

[00:32:20] decision of where we route the tokens to.

[00:32:23] We get tokens coming in here, they
go through a router layer, and then

[00:32:27] we have a bunch of different experts.

[00:32:34] I'll draw a few more to line some up.

[00:32:38] The router will make a decision
of which experts it's going to

[00:32:41] route to, and it will be a small
fraction of them, maybe 1 in 32.

[00:32:45] Maybe it will make a decision
to route to this one,

[00:32:49] maybe this one, and maybe this one.

[00:32:56] Each expert itself is a normal MLP.

[00:32:59] It has an up projection and then a down
projection with a nonlinearity in between.

[00:33:04] Then finally, we do the inverse operation.

[00:33:07] Where we were broadcasting things
out here, we're going to bring

[00:33:10] them back in and sum them up.

[00:33:16] Bringing them in like

[00:33:19] this.

[00:33:19] Then finally, we have
our residual connections.

[00:33:21] The token is also passed through
here, and it gets added to

[00:33:26] the result of the MoE layer.

[00:33:28] This is a normal MoE layer.

[00:33:31] What I want to talk through is how
this is mapped to a GPU rack and what

[00:33:37] this means for communication, because
I think this will start to show some

[00:33:41] of the limits of how sparse we can go.

[00:33:46] The standard practice here,
and it is the best solution,

[00:33:48] is to use expert parallelism.

[00:33:51] That means different experts
go on different GPUs.

[00:33:54] If we take something like a DeepSeek
model, they have 256 experts.

[00:34:00] Let's say we want to run
that on a Blackwell rack.

[00:34:04] There are 72 GPUs.

[00:34:07] We have a divisibility problem.

[00:34:09] This is not a power of two.

[00:34:11] We'll just simplify and say we're
only going to use 64 of them.

[00:34:16] Just ignore the other eight.

[00:34:17] It's not a big deal.

[00:34:18] So we have four experts per GPU.

[00:34:23] Very simple.

[00:34:24] For the sake of the diagram,
actually let's just say we

[00:34:26] have two experts per GPU.

[00:34:28] We end up just putting
these GPU boundaries.

[00:34:34] Every pair of experts is on its own GPU.

[00:34:39] Then we can look at
the communication cost.

[00:34:40] We had some tokens stored centrally here.

[00:34:44] They get routed to all of these experts,

[00:34:48] and there is some
communication cost paid here.

[00:34:51] There's the same communication
cost paid on the output.

[00:34:55] The hope is that this does not
become communication limited.

[00:34:58] Now

[00:35:01] what is the traffic pattern here?

[00:35:03] The traffic pattern here is
that any GPU will be talking to

[00:35:06] any other GPU, depending on the
decisions made by the model.

[00:35:11] This is an all-to-all traffic pattern.

[00:35:14] When you say any GPU in the pre-tense,
the router is more than one GPU?

[00:35:20] I drew this as one router.

[00:35:22] In reality, you would actually have
many copies of the router, and you would

[00:35:25] have as many routers as GPUs, in fact.

[00:35:30] As the incoming traffic.

[00:35:32] Yeah.

[00:35:33] These are 64 GPUs and these are 64 GPUs.

[00:35:37] It's actually the same GPUs, we
just draw them as separate because

[00:35:40] they're serving different purposes.

[00:35:42] So at this point, any GPU can
be sending to any other GPU.

[00:35:46] This all-to-all pattern of communication
that shows up and how the Blackwell

[00:35:52] racks are configured is a perfect fit for
the communication pattern that the MoE

[00:35:59] actually wants to do.

[00:36:01] However, if you think maybe one rack
is too slow and I want to do two

[00:36:06] racks, then I have this challenge
that maybe I've got some sort of rack

[00:36:11] boundary drawn outside here like this,

[00:36:17] and I no longer have all-to-all
communication between all

[00:36:21] the GPUs in two racks.

[00:36:24] The rack-to-rack communication ends
up being a substantial bottleneck.

[00:36:30] The fundamental thing here is
that one rack bounds the size

[00:36:33] of an expert layer you can do.

[00:36:36] This has been part of what's
been driving towards larger and

[00:36:40] larger interconnect domains.

[00:36:42] Before we continue, it may be worth
you explaining what exactly a rack is.

[00:36:47] The differences in bandwidth between
a rack and within a rack, and the

[00:36:52] all-to-all versus not all-to-all nature
of communication within versus outside.

[00:36:56] This is a place where it starts to be very
different between Nvidia, for example,

[00:37:00] and Google, and then others, including us.

[00:37:04] Generally, a rack

[00:37:09] is a physical structure.

[00:37:11] It's a few meters tall, a meter or
two wide, depending on configuration,

[00:37:16] and it stores some number of GPUs
or XPUs, which is typically about

[00:37:24] 64.

[00:37:24] What constrains it being a
certain size is power delivery,

[00:37:27] weight, and cooling ability.

[00:37:31] It ends up being about this
size in many cases because of

[00:37:34] these physical constraints.

[00:37:38] When I deploy a data center, a data
center may have thousands of these racks.

[00:37:42] I've got one of these tall racks, it's
got a bunch of GPUs in it, and so on.

[00:37:46] And then I put another rack next to it.

[00:37:50] You make it sound so easy.

[00:37:51] Right.

[00:37:52] I just drop them in.

[00:37:55] In Nvidia's case, the
communication topology…

[00:38:02] They actually put the GPUs on the
outside of the rack, and then they put

[00:38:07] these switches on the inside of the rack.

[00:38:09] What this ends up being is that
there's a set of switches in here.

[00:38:13] These are the NV switches.

[00:38:17] Then they run a bunch of cables.

[00:38:19] Every single GPU has cables going
to the switches in the middle.

[00:38:33] The switches have
connections to all the GPUs.

[00:38:35] All of the GPUs can talk to all the
other GPUs in just two hops: going to

[00:38:39] the switch, going to the other GPU.

[00:38:41] Now, when I want to leave the rack,
I end up going via a different path.

[00:38:47] The GPUs also have a much slower
connectivity, which is typically

[00:38:52] about eight times slower.

[00:38:56] The green that I drew here in
the GPU cases is the NVLink.

[00:38:59] More generally, it's called
the scale-up network.

[00:39:06] You will typically also have a
scale-out network, which allows you

[00:39:10] to connect to some data center switch.

[00:39:13] All

[00:39:19] of the GPUs will have some connectivity
up to some data center switch somewhere.

[00:39:23] This is

[00:39:26] the scale-out, and

[00:39:31] it tends to be about 8x slower

[00:39:35] in bandwidth.

[00:39:39] The challenge, if you want to lay out a
mixture of experts layer across two racks,

[00:39:44] is that half of the GPUs here are going
to be wanting to talk to the GPUs here.

[00:39:54] On average, when I look at where the
tokens on these GPUs want to go, half of

[00:39:59] the tokens want to go inside the rack.

[00:40:00] That's great.

[00:40:00] They can use the fast scale-up network.

[00:40:03] But half the tokens are going to
want to leave the rack and go to the

[00:40:06] other rack, and that's not as good.

[00:40:07] They need to use a much slower
network, and so that becomes the

[00:40:10] bottleneck on the all-to-all pattern.

[00:40:13] A different choice would be,
why don't I have a big switch

[00:40:18] here and connect everything to

[00:40:24] a much bigger switch that actually
combines the two racks together?

[00:40:27] There are many ideas in this
direction, but in general, the

[00:40:31] reason you have this hierarchy of
switches rather than one big switch

[00:40:34] is to manage the cabling congestion.

[00:40:35] You just need to run a
large number of cables.

[00:40:39] Sorry, is that question you just asked
basically, why isn't it a bigger scale-up?

[00:40:43] Exactly.

[00:40:44] Why not just have a million chips
in scale-up or a thousand chips?

[00:40:47] What has changed that has allowed Nvidia
to go from Hopper, which was 8, then

[00:40:53] Blackwell is 72, and now Rubin will be...

[00:41:00] is it 500 something?

[00:41:00] Yeah, 500 and something.

[00:41:01] What has allowed that to happen?

[00:41:02] From Hopper to Blackwell is mostly
just the decision to switch from

[00:41:10] trays as the form factor to switching
to racks as the form factor.

[00:41:15] That's a product decision.

[00:41:16] There wasn't a substantial
technical barrier there.

[00:41:21] Switching from 64 to 500 or

[00:41:27] so, there's a bit of Jensen math there,
but there is at least a genuine 4x

[00:41:33] increase, which is coming from a much more
complicated and difficult rack design.

[00:41:38] That is actually a new physical
design to run more cables.

[00:41:42] The cable complication is just the cost
of figuring out which cable hops to which,

[00:41:49] or which signal goes from what to what?

[00:41:51] Let's zoom in on this and
look at the wire density.

[00:41:57] I'll draw this diagram just once
more so we have a bit of a cleaner

[00:41:59] and larger version to work with.

[00:42:03] Let's say I have some
switches in the middle.

[00:42:04] Initially, I'm going to start
with just two GPUs on each side

[00:42:09] or two trays of GPUs on each side.

[00:42:12] Let's say maybe each tray wants to
have two cables coming out of it.

[00:42:21] I physically run vertical cables that look
like this running out to the switches.

[00:42:25] Now if I want to double the
number of GPUs in a rack,

[00:42:31] I need to run literally
twice the density of cables.

[00:42:35] I need to run

[00:42:38] these as well.

[00:42:42] Extremely naive question.

[00:42:43] But if you look at a physical
data center, it seems like there's

[00:42:47] a lot of space within a rack.

[00:42:49] I don't know.

[00:42:49] The cables are really big and...

[00:42:52] There is space outside the rack.

[00:42:54] Inside the rack… As they become
more optimized, these racks are

[00:42:59] very tight.

[00:42:59] There's

[00:43:02] connector density going from

[00:43:07] the tray into the rack and the
rack's backplane, and the backplane

[00:43:10] itself has a really high density.

[00:43:13] There are other physical constraints
including the bend radius of cables.

[00:43:16] You don't want to snap them and so on.

[00:43:19] Okay, so it's literally the physical space
to put a cable that's constraining it.

[00:43:22] I had no idea.

[00:43:23] Interesting.

[00:43:24] That seems surprising.

[00:43:25] The

[00:43:27] rack is so big and we can't
just stuff more cables in there.

[00:43:31] Rack design is not my expertise,
but when I talk to folks on what

[00:43:34] constraints they're up against,
it's a combination of things.

[00:43:39] What are the big physical
things you're optimizing for?

[00:43:42] Space, weight of the rack.

[00:43:45] It's actually really heavy, so you
need enough metal to not sag and fall.

[00:43:50] But then you add more
metal, and it's heavier.

[00:43:52] Then power and cooling.

[00:43:53] All of those are competing.

[00:43:56] Modern racks are pushing all of those
to very extreme physical limits.

[00:44:00] Deep work is by its nature quite
aversive, so even things which seem

[00:44:03] like work, like Slack and email, can
be easy ways to distract yourself.

[00:44:07] So I often wish that I could
just turn the internet off.

[00:44:11] But if I'm prepping for an interview, even
if I have the papers and books on hand,

[00:44:14] it's still super useful to be able to do a
back and forth with an LLM so I can break

[00:44:18] down concepts and research follow-ups.

[00:44:20] Google's new Gemma 4 is the first open
model that allows me to have this kind

[00:44:24] of fully disconnected focus machine.

[00:44:26] It's small enough to run on my laptop,
but good enough to actually be useful.

[00:44:29] So to prep for this episode,
I downloaded Reiner's scaling

[00:44:32] book and shut off the internet.

[00:44:33] I was able to have Gemma help
me understand the material

[00:44:35] and answer my questions.

[00:44:36] If you want an LLM that you can run
locally on your laptop or even your

[00:44:39] phone, you should check out Gemma 4.

[00:44:45] When was GPT-4 released again?

[00:44:46] Was it 2022 or 2023?

[00:44:48] 2023.

[00:44:48] Okay.

[00:44:49] And it was rumored to be
over one trillion parameters.

[00:44:53] It seems like only now, within the last
six months, have models been getting

[00:44:58] released that have significantly more
parameters than the model released three

[00:45:00] years ago, when supposedly there should
have been this scaling in the meantime.

[00:45:07] Is the reason that we were just
waiting for racks with enough memory

[00:45:11] to hold a five-trillion parameter
model, along with its KV cache for

[00:45:18] enough users for a lot of sequences?

[00:45:21] Or if you're doing RL, a similar
consideration of actually

[00:45:25] holding the KV cache for

[00:45:28] the batch of problems
you're trying to solve.

[00:45:30] If you look at Hopper, you
had eight Hoppers, and I think

[00:45:35] that's 640 gigabytes as of 2022.

[00:45:39] With Blackwell finally,
which was deployed in…?

[00:45:42] Very recently.

[00:45:43] Maybe last year.

[00:45:44] Last year.

[00:45:44] You finally have a scale-up on the
order of 10-20 terabytes, which is

[00:45:49] enough for a 5T model plus KV cache.

[00:45:53] Deploying in larger scale-up
domains is a huge unlock.

[00:45:58] I've drawn here the Nvidia
Blackwell deployment.

[00:46:01] The Google deployment has
actually had very large scale-up

[00:46:04] domains for a long time.

[00:46:05] That also explains why
Gemini seemed to be ahead.

[00:46:08] It

[00:46:11] just seems like Gemini has had
successful pre-training for longer

[00:46:14] than some of the other labs.

[00:46:15] Not having been there at the time,
I'm not sure how much is coming

[00:46:17] from successfully deploying higher
sparsity ratios, which it could be.

[00:46:22] It could also be a whole bunch
of actual modeling things,

[00:46:27] specifically how you do
the mixture of experts.

[00:46:29] We've seen

[00:46:33] the DeepSeek mixture of experts activate
more experts, but finer-grained experts.

[00:46:38] That was a big innovation.

[00:46:39] I'm sure there are many other
innovations on the model architecture

[00:46:43] as well as on the training data.

[00:46:44] It's hard to disentangle all of
them, but what shows up in terms

[00:46:48] of the limits of what you can do

[00:46:52] is that the active parameters, as
we saw, are limited by the compute

[00:46:57] cost, and the total parameters
are limited by the scale-up size.

[00:47:02] When you're operating within a
single scale-up domain, is that

[00:47:06] a consideration specifically for
either forward or backward, or

[00:47:12] specifically for prefill versus decode?

[00:47:17] Or is it preferred to always be
within a scale-up whatever kind

[00:47:23] of workload you have, whether
you're doing a pre-training run, RL

[00:47:29] generation, or inference for users?

[00:47:32] Really interesting.

[00:47:37] To answer that question, we're
going to need to talk about

[00:47:38] the communication patterns.

[00:47:40] We've talked about the mixture
of experts communication pattern.

[00:47:43] That is this all-to-all.

[00:47:51] All-to-all very strongly
favors full connectivity,

[00:47:57] which is what we've just shown here,
and it favors being within one rack.

[00:48:03] There are other kinds of parallelism
besides expert parallelism,

[00:48:06] which we just showed here.

[00:48:08] In the literature is

[00:48:12] tensor parallelism.

[00:48:12] With the trend towards smaller
experts, this has become much less

[00:48:15] relevant, so we can ignore that.

[00:48:17] But the other two things we have
available are data parallelism

[00:48:20] and pipeline parallelism.

[00:48:24] They can be a much better
fit for using multiple racks.

[00:48:28] Let's focus on pipeline
parallelism specifically.

[00:48:32] This is one layer of MoE.

[00:48:34] I'm going to have a hundred
more layers up above.

[00:48:39] I could decide at this point, for example,
to move to a different rack, change rack.

[00:48:50] Now, is that going to become
a communication bottleneck?

[00:48:54] We can actually solve for when this
becomes a communication bottleneck.

[00:48:57] Before we do that algebraically, let's

[00:49:00] visualize it out and sketch the path.

[00:49:01] We're going to have another MoE layer,
and another MoE layer here, and so on.

[00:49:09] Let's say I change rack here,
and then some number of layers

[00:49:12] later, I change rack here as

[00:49:21] well.

[00:49:21] The methodology we're going to
use to determine whether we have

[00:49:24] a communication bottleneck at the
point where we change rack is we're

[00:49:28] going to compare the scale-out

[00:49:35] bandwidth requirements to the
scale-up bandwidth requirements.

[00:49:43] Let's write this.

[00:49:44] The hint is going to be that
there's a lot more sends here.

[00:49:49] We're sending many things here, whereas
we're only sending one thing here, and

[00:49:52] we're also maybe doing it many times.

[00:49:54] That's

[00:49:56] what makes the difference.

[00:49:58] Can I try to guess?

[00:49:59] Just out of curiosity, to see if I'm
actually understanding, it seems like

[00:50:03] you're sending batch size into the rack.

[00:50:07] In here?

[00:50:08] Yes.

[00:50:09] But the communication within the rack
is batch size times number of GPUs.

[00:50:18] Number of activated GPUs.

[00:50:21] I don't send to this GPU at all.

[00:50:23] There's an explosion from 1-3x
larger here in this diagram.

[00:50:29] The key thing is that I didn't
even need to send to this GPU at

[00:50:32] all, and so that's a big saving.

[00:50:35] We're going to talk through

[00:50:40] to what extent scale-up is
a bottleneck over scale-out.

[00:50:48] We will directly jump to the ratio
of the time spent on scale-up

[00:51:00] over the time spent on scale-out.

[00:51:04] This is the quantity we're talking about.

[00:51:09] The first consideration
is that scale-up is

[00:51:15] 8x faster than scale-out generally.

[00:51:18] At a baseline, if the bandwidths
were the same, we would have this

[00:51:21] 1/8, which is coming from bandwidth.

[00:51:28] But then we have some amount of
expansion in how much data we're sending.

[00:51:34] If one token comes in here, then this
one token gets routed to, in the DeepSeek

[00:51:40] case maybe 32 experts or 16 experts.

[00:51:44] It gets routed to some number of experts.

[00:51:47] So this is the number of

[00:51:51] activated

[00:51:54] experts.

[00:52:03] This same thing applies on
multiple different layers, so

[00:52:05] maybe I'm going to run two layers.

[00:52:08] There's also multiple
times the number of layers

[00:52:16] per stage.

[00:52:19] Don't you need to multiply the whole
thing by two for the all-to-all?

[00:52:22] For the up and down.

[00:52:23] Yes, there's a factor of two.

[00:52:28] Thank you.

[00:52:29] What we would like is for the scale-up
time to be greater than the scale-out

[00:52:33] time, because the scale-up time is the
more important and precious resource.

[00:52:38] We would like this number to be
greater than or equal to one.

[00:52:43] This really doesn't seem hard.

[00:52:44] There's just a factor of 8
that we need to overcome.

[00:52:46] So we need the product of these
three things to be bigger than 8.

[00:52:50] Typically we have a fairly large
number of activated experts.

[00:52:53] It could be 8 by itself.

[00:52:55] Then we can increase the number of layers
per stage a lot until we satisfy this.

[00:53:01] What this ends up looking like is that
I can have an entire pipeline of racks

[00:53:05] where one rack does one layer, and
then I move on to the next rack and

[00:53:08] do another layer, and then I move on
to the next rack and do another layer.

[00:53:11] It's interesting to me that the best

[00:53:15] parallelism strategy in practice
ends up being one which physically

[00:53:20] resembles the actual architecture.

[00:53:23] It's not some galaxy brain thing.

[00:53:25] It's like, "Oh, we have experts, we're
going to put them on different GPUs,

[00:53:27] or we have different layers, we're
just going to put them on different

[00:53:29] racks." I feel that's interesting.

[00:53:31] The cutting matches
the model architecture.

[00:53:37] Exactly.

[00:53:38] It could have been something wackier
with tensor parallelism and whatever.

[00:53:45] The galaxy brain way to think of it is,

[00:53:49] what are all the different dimensions
in which a model is scaled up?

[00:53:54] It is scaled up by layers,

[00:53:58] it is scaled up by the model dimension,
it is scaled up by the DFF dimension, it

[00:54:00] is scaled up by the number of experts.

[00:54:02] Every single one of those numbers
you can choose to cut along.

[00:54:06] If those numbers are big
enough, it eventually becomes

[00:54:08] profitable to cut along there.

[00:54:11] We have selected two of them.

[00:54:12] The other two, in the way models are
typically sized, are not profitable.

[00:54:16] So there's a talk by Ilya where
he says, "Today we know not

[00:54:21] to do pipeline parallelism."

[00:54:23] And Horace He gave my friends
and me… I hate that it sounds

[00:54:29] like a Dr. Seuss quote.

[00:54:33] But he gave us a lecture on these
different kinds of parallelisms.

[00:54:36] He said the problem with pipeline
parallelism is that, other than

[00:54:39] the bubbles, it creates these
architectural constraints.

[00:54:42] Kimi,

[00:54:45] for example, has these residuals where
attention attends to layers a few back, so

[00:54:52] it becomes hard to implement in this way.

[00:54:56] I guess we didn't fully
articulate even what is the

[00:54:59] benefit that we're getting from

[00:55:05] pipelining.

[00:55:05] These complexities are real.

[00:55:06] Pipelining is a massive hassle,
but it does give you some benefits.

[00:55:15] You can then decide whether those
benefits are worth the costs.

[00:55:22] It has some benefits in inference,
maybe bigger benefits in training.

[00:55:25] In inference, what are we saving on?

[00:55:27] Are we saving on memory
time or compute time?

[00:55:31] Not really.

[00:55:32] We're just moving the memory time
from one chip to another chip,

[00:55:35] or one rack to a different rack.

[00:55:37] There's no actual benefit in runtime.

[00:55:41] However, what we are saving
on is memory capacity.

[00:55:45] If we think that the memory in a
rack is a bottleneck, then there's

[00:55:51] a constraint on how fast we can go.

[00:55:55] Pipelining allows us to
massively reduce that bottleneck.

[00:55:59] The opposite connotation to this…
Before this interview, I was

[00:56:06] chatting with Axel, who's a GPU
performance engineer at Jane Street.

[00:56:11] He was explaining that to do
pipelining, you have to do

[00:56:13] micro-batches rather than full batches.

[00:56:16] If you do micro-batches, then
you're by definition not able to

[00:56:23] amortize loading the weights across
all the users or all the sequences.

[00:56:30] The positive connotation of that is
you don't have to use as much memory.

[00:56:32] The negative connotation is that
we can't amortize loading the

[00:56:36] weights across all those users.

[00:56:37] Maybe it's worth explaining why
you have to do micro-batches.

[00:56:40] Shall we draw the pipeline bubble?

[00:56:46] What is this micro-batching
that shows up in pipeline

[00:56:53] parallelism?

[00:56:53] I'll focus on inference first.

[00:56:55] It's a slightly simpler problem.

[00:56:56] I'm going to draw time,
and then which rack

[00:57:06] we're on.

[00:57:07] The idea is that maybe
I'll have four racks.

[00:57:10] I've got an inference that is
going to step through these four

[00:57:14] racks in some time like this.

[00:57:19] This is inference number zero.

[00:57:20] It

[00:57:23] runs at a certain batch size and steps
through all the pipeline stages like this.

[00:57:28] Now, if we were to say, "Well, we're
going to run inference number one

[00:57:30] here," this is clearly a massive waste.

[00:57:34] Like three-quarters of the
time each of the racks is doing

[00:57:40] nothing.

[00:57:40] We don't actually run inference one here,
we run it as soon as we can, which is

[00:57:44] immediately after inference zero finishes.

[00:57:47] And

[00:57:50] then we keep going.

[00:57:53] If we hadn't filled this in, we
would call this the pipeline bubble.

[00:57:56] When I've drawn it in this inference
context where we're only going

[00:57:58] in a forwards pass, it's obvious.

[00:58:00] Why would you do this stupid thing?

[00:58:02] In a training context,
it's maybe less obvious.

[00:58:05] But in the inference context, it's
really natural to make this change.

[00:58:09] Oh, interesting.

[00:58:14] This is sort of obvious, but the
difference between micro-batch and batch

[00:58:16] doesn't matter at all in inference because
you can just call it whatever you want.

[00:58:22] It only matters in training because
there is an optimal batch size.

[00:58:27] Yes.

[00:58:28] Before you do a full backward
step, you want to have accumulated

[00:58:33] all the sequences in that batch.

[00:58:33] If you want to do

[00:58:38] pipelining in training, in order
to avoid that bubble, you need to—

[00:58:43] Should we draw the training diagram

[00:58:48] with that?

[00:58:48] Let’s do that.

[00:58:48] This is the inference diagram, and
I'll call this forward so we don't

[00:58:51] have the wrong thing showing up there.

[00:58:53] Let's do the same thing for training now.

[00:58:55] We've got a forwards pass, but at
some stage we're going to have to

[00:58:57] transition to a backwards pass.

[00:59:01] We'll do some number of
batches in the forwards pass,

[00:59:11] and then we're going to transition to
the backwards pass for everyone all

[00:59:24] in one go.

[00:59:24] The inference part is the same here,
but then we do a hard stop at this point

[00:59:28] and transition everyone to the backwards
pass, with similar numbering like this.

[00:59:33] It may be worth clarifying the
reason there is that hard stop

[00:59:35] is because you want to do a whole
batch at once for the backward step.

[00:59:40] And then there is an optimal size
for how big that batch should be.

[00:59:45] Smaller is always better,
actually, is a way to put it.

[00:59:48] From an ML convergence rate
perspective, smaller is always better

[00:59:53] because you're getting the freshest
information from the gradient descent.

[00:59:55] But from a total training
time perspective?

[00:59:58] From a total training time
perspective, smaller is worse

[01:00:01] from a systems perspective.

[01:00:02] The optimum is the
trade-off between those two.

[01:00:05] So you pick a batch size, and

[01:00:10] for that batch size, you do some amount
forwards and then some amount backwards.

[01:00:14] You asked why there is
even a hard stop there.

[01:00:16] With pipeline parallelism, because

[01:00:21] you've got this idle time here which
is the bubble, there are so many

[01:00:26] techniques in the literature for how to
lay this out differently and avoid that.

[01:00:31] There are more complicated schemes called
zero bubble or one-forward-one-backward,

[01:00:35] which interweave the forwards and
the backwards in complicated ways.

[01:00:40] You can mine Bitcoin in that bubble.

[01:00:42] Right.

[01:00:42] More usefully, you can do
the weight gradient step, but

[01:00:46] you can also mine Bitcoin.

[01:00:49] In inference, the effect of pipelining
on anything you care about, like

[01:00:55] batch size or latency, is neutral.

[01:00:58] It doesn't improve it,
it doesn't make it worse.

[01:01:00] If you look at the latency of this
inference, running it if it were pipelined

[01:01:03] versus if it were all on one rack… If it
were all on one rack, we would just slide

[01:01:07] all the boxes down and still put them in
a row, and the latency would be the same.

[01:01:11] Pipelining

[01:01:14] is neither better nor worse for latency.

[01:01:17] It does mean that you just use
less memory capacity per rack.

[01:01:23] Because now instead of needing the
whole model, you only need a quarter

[01:01:25] of the model, and you can expand.

[01:01:26] Makes a ton of sense.

[01:01:27] So it's a no-brainer to use pipelining
during inference, but there's this

[01:01:33] harder trade-off during training.

[01:01:36] Even in inference, in
fact, it is not used a ton.

[01:01:39] It reduces your memory capacity
requirements, but there's

[01:01:42] actually a huge surplus.

[01:01:44] I think you were saying that a rack of
Blackwell has many tens of terabytes.

[01:01:52] That's much bigger than a
trillion parameter model.

[01:01:58] A trillion parameter model only needs
one terabyte, so it already fits.

[01:01:59] There's not a huge benefit from
pipelining because you're reducing a

[01:02:05] number that's already pretty small.

[01:02:07] But it does say that theoretically,
maybe you had too much memory there.

[01:02:11] You could have

[01:02:14] built different hardware
that has less memory.

[01:02:16] If you were designing your hardware,
you could say, "I didn't need that

[01:02:19] much memory because I don't need
the weights to fit in one rack.

[01:02:22] I can fit the weights in eight racks,
then I could have built hardware that

[01:02:28] didn't have so much HBM per GPU."

[01:02:30] Last week, Horace He was kind enough to
give me and my friends a great lecture

[01:02:34] on large-scale pre-training systems.

[01:02:36] And there were some concepts that
I wanted to animate for a write-up

[01:02:39] on my blog, like how weights shard
and gradients flow depending on

[01:02:43] the parallelism that you're using.

[01:02:45] So I gave Cursor my lecture notes and a
sketch that I made during the lecture.

[01:02:49] And I asked it to visualize a
specific hierarchical collective

[01:02:53] that Horace had explained.

[01:02:55] The first version was already pretty
good, and then I was able to use

[01:02:57] design mode to select and tweak
any specific components from there.

[01:03:01] I was able to do all of this
without a clear end state in mind.

[01:03:03] Cursor's Composer 2 Fast model was
quick enough that I was able to

[01:03:06] iterate almost instantaneously.

[01:03:08] I could try an idea, test the
results in the built-in browser,

[01:03:11] and immediately make any changes.

[01:03:13] I went through 10 different
versions in under 20 minutes.

[01:03:15] If you want to check out this
animation, I published it along with

[01:03:18] the lecture notes in a blog post.

[01:03:20] The link is in the description.

[01:03:21] And if you want to try out this kind of
iterative design flow for yourself, go

[01:03:24] to cursor.com/dwarkesh to get started.

[01:03:31] everybody's talking about
the memory wall right now.

[01:03:33] Memory is getting super expensive.

[01:03:34] There's not enough memory.

[01:03:36] Smartphone volume will go down 30%
because there's not enough memory.

[01:03:41] This is shocking, Dylan said
hyperscalers are spending 50% of

[01:03:45] their CapEx this year on memory.

[01:03:47] That’s believable.

[01:03:50] What is hyperscaler CapEx?

[01:03:51] That's high hundreds of billions,
maybe a trillion, and they're

[01:03:54] spending half of that on memory?

[01:03:57] That is a huge constraint.

[01:03:58] That's why we're not going to get
new laptops and phones this year.

[01:04:00] But at the same time,
we have too much memory?

[01:04:04] People are willing to put too
much memory into these systems.

[01:04:06] Why is Jensen shoving all this memory
into these racks if you don't need it?

[01:04:14] In the equations we had here before we
erased them, we were doing memory time,

[01:04:18] memory bandwidth and compute bandwidth.

[01:04:20] Let's now start looking
at memory capacity.

[01:04:23] We'll start off with memory
capacity without even thinking

[01:04:26] about a parallelism scheme.

[01:04:35] The demand on memory is the
number of total parameters.

[01:04:43] This is what we need to fit the weights
in some system that we are using.

[01:04:48] Then we need to fit the KVs as well.

[01:04:51] KVs go as batch size times
the length of the context

[01:04:56] times the bytes per

[01:05:06] token.

[01:05:07] What I was arguing about in this
context, and the case I was making

[01:05:10] for pipelining, is that there are some
techniques that allow us to solve this.

[01:05:18] Let's consider running this
on some number of GPUs.

[01:05:23] We're going to have one extent, which

[01:05:28] is E, the expert

[01:05:32] parallelism.

[01:05:33] When we had this sharding of an
expert layer across many GPUs,

[01:05:38] to what extent do we do that?

[01:05:39] How many GPUs?

[01:05:42] We're going to say that
this is, for example 64.

[01:05:46] Then P is going to be the extent of

[01:05:52] pipelining.

[01:05:52] This is the number of racks,

[01:05:56] maybe we'll pick 4 or something

[01:06:01] like that.

[01:06:03] This is the total memory
requirement across the system,

[01:06:07] but now I'm going to calculate a

[01:06:11] memory requirement per GPU.

[01:06:20] I'll use a lowercase

[01:06:26] cmem.

[01:06:26] Obviously, we just take all
of these numbers and divide

[01:06:27] it by E and P. Really easy.

[01:06:29] It's

[01:06:32] this Ntotal, plus the batch times
length of context times bytes per

[01:06:42] token, all divided by E times P.

[01:06:49] Why is this correct as divided this way?

[01:06:54] We knew that the parameters were perfectly
divided amongst all the GPUs in a rack.

[01:07:00] The layers are perfectly divided
amongst the different racks.

[01:07:04] So that works here.

[01:07:05] Somehow we're going to arrange—I'll
hand-wave exactly how—the same

[01:07:10] perfect sharding of the contexts
across GPUs in a rack, and then

[01:07:15] based on layer across racks.

[01:07:17] Sorry, 4 is the number of racks?

[01:07:18] Yeah, for

[01:07:25] example.

[01:07:26] This is the place where we actually need
to go back and analyze this batch size B.

[01:07:30] You were making this comment that
there's micro-batching versus global

[01:07:35] batching.

[01:07:35] Let's come back to this
pipelining diagram here.

[01:07:38] We've got one batch going forward
here, and then as I drew it,

[01:07:42] it kind of just disappeared.

[01:07:44] That's not really correct.

[01:07:45] If you think about how decode is
working, I have a bunch of tokens

[01:07:50] that I have generated already.

[01:07:52] I do one forwards pass where
I generate a new token,

[01:07:57] and then I write that to my KV cache.

[01:08:00] Then I do another forwards pass
that generates the next token.

[01:08:04] I'm actually going to be running
this batch zero in a loop.

[01:08:06] In fact, I go forwards.

[01:08:10] Once I finish, I can start the
next iteration of the loop up here.

[01:08:17] We'll just

[01:08:29] fill this in.

[01:08:29] We've got the two,

[01:08:36] three, two and three, and two and three.

[01:08:36] Let's split this batch.

[01:08:38] This batch will be the global batch size.

[01:08:41] B is going to be the number
of micro-batches times

[01:08:51] the batch size per micro-batch.

[01:08:53] How many micro-batches do we need?

[01:08:55] The number of micro-batches in this
diagram is 4: zero, one, two, three.

[01:09:03] The micro-batch size is
still this 2000-ish number.

[01:09:08] Sorry, no, this is the

[01:09:14] 300 times sparsity.

[01:09:16] This is

[01:09:22] how big the train that takes
off every 20 milliseconds is.

[01:09:23] Right.

[01:09:23] This is going to be the
20-millisecond train.

[01:09:29] The global batch size is the number of
micro-batches times the local batch size.

[01:09:33] Local batch size is set by
this hardware parameter.

[01:09:35] The number of micro-batches

[01:09:39] is as small as possible, such that we can
wrap around and not leave any idle time.

[01:09:47] If we had fewer, we would have
this idle time when we wrap around.

[01:09:51] You can visually see that it is equal
to the number of pipeline stages.

[01:09:55] It's a proof by visual here.

[01:09:57] It is 4, and it's 4 this way as well.

[01:09:59] You can look and see that it goes
along here, and then it wraps around

[01:10:03] to the number of pipeline stages.

[01:10:05] Sorry, very basic question.

[01:10:06] Is this what is actually done?

[01:10:10] A frontier model today will have
pipelining during inference?

[01:10:15] For sure during massive
scale training this is done.

[01:10:19] It can be done for inference.

[01:10:21] I'm actually going to make the
case for why it is less attractive.

[01:10:24] It is useful for weights,
but not so useful for KVs.

[01:10:28] The

[01:10:30] big challenge is... Let's fill this in.

[01:10:33] The micro-batch size here ends up being
equal to the number of pipeline stages.

[01:10:40] When we go back and substitute
all of that into here,

[01:10:49] we get

[01:10:52] a number of pipeline stages times
this little b showing up in here.

[01:10:59] When we factor this out, I'm going
to split this plus into two terms.

[01:11:04] We

[01:11:08] get the full division
by E times P over here.

[01:11:12] We still have division by E times
P over here, but the Ps cancel.

[01:11:22] What we find is that if you increase
the number of pipeline stages, the

[01:11:26] memory footprint for the number of
weights keeps going down and down and

[01:11:29] down, but the memory footprint for the
number of activations stays constant.

[01:11:34] So it doesn't actually work.

[01:11:37] Most of your memory…

[01:11:40] Once you do enough pipelining—and it's
really not much, even two is often

[01:11:44] enough—this term becomes very small.

[01:11:48] The KV cache becomes the dominant term.

[01:11:52] I know this is wrong.

[01:11:53] I'm just trying to think about why
my train of logic here is wrong.

[01:11:56] If

[01:11:59] you're pipelining through many
different stages, the KV values

[01:12:02] are not shared between layers.

[01:12:03] Why would it not help to be
pipelining across multiple layers?

[01:12:06] Because then you don't have to store...

[01:12:08] You only need to store one layer
rather than two layers of KVs.

[01:12:12] It helps from that
perspective, you're right.

[01:12:16] What's competing with that, though,
is that you need to be keeping all

[01:12:19] of the racks usefully busy at a time,
so the number of sequences that are

[01:12:24] in flight simultaneously has gone up.

[01:12:27] Ah, that makes sense.

[01:12:28] Those exactly cancel, and you end
up not getting a saving per GPU.

[01:12:31] Right.

[01:12:32] This is going back fundamentally
to the point of how you're not

[01:12:34] able to amortize across KV caches.

[01:12:38] First, we established you can’t
amortize KV caches across batch size.

[01:12:41] Now we're saying you also can't
shard it across pipeline stages.

[01:12:48] It sucks from both of
those points of view.

[01:12:49] Interesting.

[01:12:50] So then what is done during inference?

[01:12:54] The DeepSeek paper reports what
they do, which is that they just

[01:12:58] do a lot of expert parallelism.

[01:13:00] In effect, you should increase your expert
parallelism up to your scale-up domain

[01:13:04] size, and then do very little pipelining.

[01:13:08] Maybe none at all, maybe two,
just enough to make the weight

[01:13:12] storage not too big of an issue.

[01:13:15] Those are the only two parallelisms
that really make sense.

[01:13:17] In the past, there was tensor parallelism,
which was cutting up within an expert,

[01:13:24] but the experts are so small now that
that is not a profitable optimization.

[01:13:30] Does that mean that frontier labs,
when they're doing inference, are

[01:13:33] just within a single scale-up?

[01:13:35] Yes.

[01:13:36] You can look at how it
depends on model size.

[01:13:41] You could have a very large model,

[01:13:46] one that exceeds the memory of a rack.

[01:13:49] There you should be doing
a bit of pipelining.

[01:13:52] Maybe it's extremely sparse, for example,
and that would be a reason to do it.

[01:13:56] This goes back to the promise
at the beginning of the lecture,

[01:14:00] which was this will actually tell
you about AI progress as well.

[01:14:03] To the extent it is the case that model
size scaling has been slow until recently…

[01:14:10] Let me make sure I understand the claim.

[01:14:12] The claim would not be you could
have trained across more racks.

[01:14:17] It was just that it would not have made
sense before, we didn't have the ability

[01:14:20] to do inference for a bigger model easily.

[01:14:24] Actually, pipelining doesn't
help with context length.

[01:14:29] It totally helps with model size.

[01:14:31] Because of the ability to do
pipelining, a rack at least should

[01:14:36] not be a constraint on your ability
to fit the model parameters.

[01:14:40] The other consideration you're asking
is, why hasn't it scaled up more, and

[01:14:43] why did bigger scale-up domains help?

[01:14:46] We talked through one aspect
of that, which is that it's

[01:14:49] not because of memory capacity.

[01:14:52] We have a solution to the memory capacity
at least with respect to model size,

[01:14:55] not with respect to KV cache size but
at least with respect to model size.

[01:15:03] The other issue that shows up is latency.

[01:15:06] I was just about to ask, going from rack
to rack, what is the latency cost per hop?

[01:15:13] This is very much
dependent on the hardware.

[01:15:20] I can't say with a lot of authority.

[01:15:21] I think it's probably on the order of
a few milliseconds, but it could be

[01:15:24] off by an order of magnitude there.

[01:15:26] Is 4 a realistic number of how many
pipelining stages you might have?

[01:15:28] Yes.

[01:15:29] So that's not that much.

[01:15:31] On a small number of pipelining stages,
this is not a huge latency impact.

[01:15:35] But I guess it's 10
milliseconds per token.

[01:15:39] That's right.

[01:15:39] 2 times 4-ish, or I don't know
how many you said… 10 milliseconds

[01:15:45] per token is actually a lot.

[01:15:46] If it goes from 20 to 30, or something

[01:15:50] like that…

[01:15:50] Just to chart the path that it goes
through, here you're going from your

[01:15:56] GPU or TPU to a network card, which

[01:16:04] then goes to a top-of-rack switch,

[01:16:08] and then hops over to the other rack
and does the same thing in reverse.

[01:16:12] You have to sum up the latencies
of these different things.

[01:16:15] Sorry, is this the same thing
as the data center switch?

[01:16:18] It may in fact go up to a
data center switch and back.

[01:16:21] It depends on deployment configuration.

[01:16:22] Got it.

[01:16:24] And because it's decode and sequential,

[01:16:30] they stack up across the stages.

[01:16:32] You can't do them at the same time.

[01:16:34] That’s right.

[01:16:36] This brings us back to the question
then, is the size of the scale-up at

[01:16:39] all relevant to why AI model sizes
have been what they have been over

[01:16:44] the last few years, whether through
training or through inference?

[01:16:48] We talked about latency of the hop.

[01:16:53] There is also just the tmem

[01:16:56] latency.

[01:16:57] The memory time latency is
actually massively improved

[01:17:02] by larger scale-up domains.

[01:17:06] I'll recall tmem down here.

[01:17:07] tmem for the weights

[01:17:18] was equal to the number
of total parameters

[01:17:24] divided by the memory bandwidth.

[01:17:28] Which memory bandwidth
are we talking about here?

[01:17:30] Is it just one GPU?

[01:17:32] It

[01:17:34] is the number of GPUs that I can use
in parallel to load these weights.

[01:17:40] I can't use different pipeline stages
in parallel because they're not

[01:17:43] running at the same time, but I can
use all the GPUs in my scale-up domain

[01:17:46] in parallel to load the weights.

[01:17:50] This is actually extremely effective.

[01:17:54] Basically, I end up with a term
here, this memory bandwidth term

[01:17:57] itself is equal to scale-up size...

[01:18:03] Times memory bandwidth per GPU.

[01:18:05] Yeah.

[01:18:05] Times GPU

[01:18:09] bandwidth.

[01:18:10] This term doesn't increase a lot.

[01:18:11] It maybe increases 1.5 or 2x per
generation, but this one increased

[01:18:14] by a factor of 8 from Hopper.

[01:18:16] So the reason the bigger scale-up matters,
it's not the memory capacity of the whole

[01:18:19] scale-up, but really the memory bandwidth.

[01:18:21] Yeah.

[01:18:22] Pipelining totally solves
the capacity problem, but

[01:18:27] scale-up size helps solve
the bandwidth problem.

[01:18:30] And the bandwidth problem helps
you do longer context lengths,

[01:18:34] which is more and more relevant
as these models get more agentic.

[01:18:37] It lets you just run the model at
lower latency as a first thing.

[01:18:41] If I just do a very sparse model
and it's on a little H100 box,

[01:18:46] the latency will be really high.

[01:18:49] A super tangential question.

[01:18:53] There's Chinchilla scaling, which
tells you how big a model should

[01:18:57] be relative to the amount of
data you're going to train it on.

[01:19:01] But now, obviously, you're not just trying
to optimize for the highest quality model

[01:19:07] you could get with training compute.

[01:19:09] You want the best results a
user can get with a mixture of

[01:19:11] training and inference compute.

[01:19:14] So there's a question of how much
you should over-train a model

[01:19:18] such that compute amortized over
training and inference is minimized

[01:19:23] to get a certain performance.

[01:19:24] But now with RL, there's another
consideration which is, you're going

[01:19:30] to do some amount of pre-training.

[01:19:32] That pre-training will be used
both for RL generation and then

[01:19:36] for inference for the final user.

[01:19:39] By over-training here I mean that while it
would have been more efficient just from

[01:19:42] a training compute perspective to have a
bigger model that you train for less time

[01:19:46] because it can learn faster, maybe you
get a smaller model, spend more compute

[01:19:50] training it than you otherwise would have,
but now it's cheaper to give it to users.

[01:19:55] Let me make the question more concrete.

[01:19:56] Basically, how much more than Chinchilla
optimal are models over-trained?

[01:20:00] And has that changed as a
result of RL generation?

[01:20:03] This is a place where we have to do a
bit of guesswork because the updated

[01:20:07] scaling laws and the model traffic are
not reported, so we have to guess there.

[01:20:14] One way to look at it…

[01:20:19] Let me first just make a
general heuristic claim.

[01:20:23] If I have some cost, and I've got a
total cost which is a sum of cost A

[01:20:30] and cost B, like maybe this is the
training cost and this is the inference

[01:20:34] cost, and I want to minimize this sum…

[01:20:39] For many

[01:20:42] curves, the minimum tends to be
where the costs are equalized.

[01:20:47] That's something of a heuristic claim, but

[01:20:52] there are many examples where it's true.

[01:20:54] Where one is 1/x and the other one is x,
for example, they tend to be minimized

[01:20:59] at the point where they equal each other.

[01:21:03] It's also true for ex and e-x
and all kinds of other things.

[01:21:10] Basically, I've got some curve
that's going down, some other curve

[01:21:14] that's going up, and they tend to
be minimized at this equal point.

[01:21:17] Heuristically,

[01:21:21] I will conjecture that that is
true for the setup you described as

[01:21:27] well.

[01:21:28] Actually showing that would be
true would require looking at the

[01:21:30] scaling laws and fitting these weird
exponents, but things that follow

[01:21:37] power laws tend to have this property.

[01:21:39] So I'll just make that claim and move on.

[01:21:43] We're going to say that we want
to equalize the cost of training

[01:21:47] and the cost of inference.

[01:21:56] We can do all of it in general.

[01:21:58] The cost of pre-training,
that's the number of

[01:22:05] active params times the
data on pre-training.

[01:22:13] There's a factor of 6 out here,
which is the number of FLOPs.

[01:22:16] There's the famous 6ND formula.

[01:22:18] Then

[01:22:20] in RL, we have approximately
the same thing.

[01:22:24] We've got the same number of
active parameters, but now the

[01:22:28] amount of data is the RL data.

[01:22:31] There is this extra efficiency
multiplier, or inefficiency...

[01:22:42] Which is the fact that you're not
training on all your rollouts.

[01:22:45] Well, there's that, and then
the other, perhaps even bigger

[01:22:49] inefficiency is that this involves
a substantial amount of decode.

[01:22:54] Often decode runs at
less MFU than training.

[01:22:58] Okay.

[01:22:59] So if you're doing a backward
pass on every single generation

[01:23:03] in RL, it would be 6ND.

[01:23:06] So this could be a smaller number, right?

[01:23:07] It

[01:23:09] would at least be two,
because that's the lower...

[01:23:11] Somewhere in the range of two to six.

[01:23:12] We'll say somewhere in the
range of two to six and leave it

[01:23:18] at that.

[01:23:18] Then we can add in the inference cost.

[01:23:20] The inference cost is two, the
number of active parameters

[01:23:24] times the data in inference.

[01:23:28] Sorry, I think the way I
said it was super garbled.

[01:23:30] Just for the audience,

[01:23:33] forward plus backwards per parameter is 6.

[01:23:37] Forward alone is 2.

[01:23:39] That's why RL, where you're definitely
going to generate all the trajectories

[01:23:43] but you might or might not train
all the trajectories, is 2 to 6.

[01:23:46] Yes.

[01:23:48] Thank you.

[01:23:48] And then inference is just 2.

[01:23:51] We're going to solve for essentially
equality of all three of these terms.

[01:23:54] That is the ballpark of
where people are going to be.

[01:23:58] Labs have more information on what
is productive in doing more RL, for

[01:24:03] example, versus doing more pre-training.

[01:24:04] I don't have that information,
but I think a good ballpark is a

[01:24:09] 33% split between each of them.

[01:24:11] I'm not sure I understand
the intuition for that.

[01:24:15] Another naive model could have been
that RL plus pre-training would

[01:24:17] be 50% and inference would be 50%.

[01:24:20] That's also a valid answer.

[01:24:24] Because this is heuristic, I can't
really argue for one versus the other.

[01:24:27] They don't differ by that much.

[01:24:28] Thirty-three versus twenty-five
is only a small factor off.

[01:24:36] Let's pick one of them.

[01:24:38] All equal seems simple enough,

[01:24:42] so we're just going to
solve for equality of them.

[01:24:44] It's pretty straightforward.

[01:24:45] We can immediately see that the
number of activated parameters totally

[01:24:47] disappears, so let's factor that out.

[01:24:49] We're going to just say that data in
pre-training—I decided to do it your

[01:24:55] way, it's a little bit nicer—plus...

[01:24:59] Oh,

[01:25:02] I didn't have the
inefficiency over here either.

[01:25:04] Data

[01:25:08] in pre-training plus some multiple
of α times the data in RL is

[01:25:17] going to end up equal to some
β times the data in inference.

[01:25:28] Let's just roughly size the α.

[01:25:30] This α

[01:25:37] is maybe somewhere in the range of 2 to 6.

[01:25:40] Over 6, from this term
compared to this term.

[01:25:44] And then we've got an inefficiency
term, which I would say is

[01:25:47] maybe in the range of 30%.

[01:25:50] So this alpha is going
to be something like

[01:25:59] 1/10.

[01:26:00] And this β here is actually the same.

[01:26:02] It's a third.

[01:26:03] It's one third times 30%.

[01:26:05] So it also equals 1/10.

[01:26:11] If both of them are one in ten,
that kind of implies that there's

[01:26:13] never a backward pass on RL?

[01:26:15] Yeah.

[01:26:15] Okay, we can make this 2/10.

[01:26:17] Make it a bit bigger.

[01:26:20] Just write it out once more,
this is 2/10, this is 1/10.

[01:26:27] The number of inference tokens you
have is just a function of hundreds

[01:26:32] of millions of tokens per second times
my model is deployed for two months

[01:26:37] before I ship to the next version.

[01:26:40] That should determine

[01:26:45] the number of tokens
in RL and pre-training.

[01:26:48] I guess we didn't do the
equivalence between pre-training

[01:26:50] and RL, so we'll do that here.

[01:26:52] Data in pre-training should be
equal to 2/10 data in RL for

[01:26:57] them to be cost equivalent.

[01:27:03] Sorry, 1/10.

[01:27:04] I got it backwards.

[01:27:06] We pay more cost when it's
inefficient, so this needs to be 1/10.

[01:27:15] Tracing this back… This thing ends
up actually being, as written here…

[01:27:21] This is like 1.5, and this is one.

[01:27:28] Billions of dollars worth of compute
just flowed in the other direction.

[01:27:31] Right?

[01:27:33] I think if you do it with a
spreadsheet and actually model

[01:27:35] it out, you might notice when
the money’s going down the drain.

[01:27:42] All of these end up being
close in, as modeled here.

[01:27:45] This 30% may have been a
little bit too generous.

[01:27:47] So let's say something like 1.5
here, and leave this as a one here.

[01:27:53] I think at this point, you
can almost read it off.

[01:27:56] The number of inference tokens should
be about the same as the number of

[01:27:58] pre-training tokens, which should
be about the same as the number

[01:28:00] of RL tokens, within factors that
we're not able to reason about.

[01:28:08] Sorry for making a basic algebra mistake.

[01:28:09] It seems like there should be fewer
RL tokens than pre-training tokens?

[01:28:12] That's in general right.

[01:28:13] Because RL is less efficient
in terms of machine time,

[01:28:22] if you're trying to equalize the
RL and pre-training time, then

[01:28:24] you should have fewer tokens in
order to have the same wall time.

[01:28:28] This is all quite interesting.

[01:28:31] I never thought about it in
terms of equalizing data.

[01:28:35] I think starting with equalizing
in cost is right, but depending

[01:28:39] on how you model the cost, this
comes close to equalizing in data.

[01:28:42] So for GPT to be trained optimally,
every single user who uses GPT-5,

[01:28:51] the total amount of tokens that they
stream should equal the total amount

[01:28:53] that has gone into pre-training.

[01:28:54] And the total amount of tokens
that have gone into pre-training

[01:28:58] is the sum of all human knowledge.

[01:29:01] Each model should generate the
sum of human knowledge on the

[01:29:04] output that it gets on the input.

[01:29:06] Yeah.

[01:29:07] Which way are people going to err?

[01:29:08] If you think that people's power of
prediction is not perfect, and also you

[01:29:14] run the risk that you make a model that
is not a frontier model and then you

[01:29:19] just throw it away, then that changes
the cost trade-off because there's some

[01:29:26] probability that applies to the inference.

[01:29:28] And you should derate the
inference tokens by some amount.

[01:29:30] Right.

[01:29:31] Can we back out how much more
compute than Chinchilla optimal

[01:29:37] for a given sized model?

[01:29:40] I think we just have to make some
real-world assumptions here in order to do

[01:29:45] that.

[01:29:46] The inference tokens, we should
totally be able to count, right?

[01:29:49] Let's say a few hundred million.

[01:29:51] Maybe it's five hundred million tokens
a second now, I don't really know.

[01:29:56] Five hundred million
tokens a second times.

[01:29:58] A model is deployed for two
months before it becomes obsolete?

[01:30:02] I

[01:30:05] can't do this in my head.

[01:30:06] Can you type it into a computer?

[01:30:08] 2.6 x 1015.

[01:30:15] Okay.

[01:30:15] 2.6 x 1015.

[01:30:20] This number is probably too
large because this is going to

[01:30:23] be multiple models in a family.

[01:30:25] Let's make it

[01:30:30] 5x smaller or 10x smaller or something

[01:30:33] like that.

[01:30:35] So we're estimating maybe fifty million
tokens per second, per specific model.

[01:30:41] The model is live for two months.

[01:30:46] This comes out to around
two hundred trillion tokens.

[01:30:50] And then we want to compare that to
active parameters on a frontier model.

[01:30:55] I don't actually know the latest rumors.

[01:30:57] Do

[01:31:00] you know?

[01:31:01] Somebody told me a hundred
and fifty trillion.

[01:31:03] Active parameters?

[01:31:04] Sorry, I meant tokens.

[01:31:06] Trained on a hundred and
fifty trillion tokens.

[01:31:07] Interesting.

[01:31:08] Which is similar.

[01:31:09] That's actually similar.

[01:31:11] So data on pre-training.

[01:31:12] This is not well-cited but it’s fine.

[01:31:17] I think often the number
of active parameters

[01:31:21] could be in the range of

[01:31:30] a hundred billion, something like that.

[01:31:31] Maybe a bit larger.

[01:31:31] So multiply by 20 to get
the Chinchilla token count.

[01:31:34] So Chinchilla, DChinchilla,
would be around two trillion.

[01:31:43] We see we're about a hundred
times larger than that.

[01:31:47] What does DChinchilla actually mean?

[01:31:48] The token count for pre-training

[01:31:53] that the Chinchilla scaling
law would recommend, I guess.

[01:31:56] Oh, I see.

[01:31:57] So how much is it over-trained?

[01:31:59] Got it.

[01:32:00] The ratio of this two hundred trillion
or a hundred trillion parameters over the

[01:32:07] Chinchilla optimal of two trillion,
that's the amount it's over-trained.

[01:32:10] Which is a factor of a
hundred over-trained.

[01:32:12] A hundred.

[01:32:14] So if you consider this right here,
to the extent this is in the right

[01:32:16] ballpark, just by thinking about how you
want everything to be equal in terms of

[01:32:22] compute… If OpenAI also realizes that
and they're serving a certain amount of

[01:32:28] tokens per second, that tells you how much
data went into the pre-training of GPT-5.

[01:32:34] Even if it's 50% off or something, it
is wild that you can first-principles

[01:32:40] these kinds of numbers.

[01:32:41] This is why you should just
approximate everywhere, because

[01:32:44] there are big error bars on this.

[01:32:45] But it's kind of empowering to just
set A equal to B and figure it out.

[01:32:49] That's super cool.

[01:32:51] Okay, so in the spirit of trying to
deduce things, we can publicly look

[01:32:56] up the API prices of these models, and
maybe we can learn something from that.

[01:33:03] First, with longer context, Gemini 3.1
is 50% more expensive if you go over 200k

[01:33:15] tokens than if you're below 200k tokens.

[01:33:21] At a high level, I understand why
that might be, but why specifically

[01:33:26] 50%?

[01:33:27] Why specifically 50%?

[01:33:30] The high level, even in the first
place, is that there is some amount of

[01:33:36] increasing cost with context length.

[01:33:42] We can bring that back up.

[01:33:43] That was

[01:33:46] the memory time versus the compute time.

[01:33:50] We've put up these same equations
from before, of the time for memory

[01:33:54] fetches which is the weights and
the KV cache, and then the time for

[01:33:58] the compute which is just the matrix
multiplications for the weights.

[01:34:03] I will also draw the cost curve, but
this time I'll do it as a function of

[01:34:05] context length instead of batch size.

[01:34:05] So this is the cost curve as

[01:34:13] a function of context length.

[01:34:26] We'll draw the compute.

[01:34:28] The cost of the compute is actually
constant as a function of context length.

[01:34:31] There's no dependence
here on context length.

[01:34:33] In reality, there is some dependence,
but it is very mild, so we'll ignore it.

[01:34:38] So this is the time for the compute.

[01:34:48] Then we'll also draw the dependence
of the memory fetch on context length.

[01:34:53] This starts at a large number
for the weights and then grows

[01:34:56] gradually with the context length.

[01:35:00] Maybe starting here, and then grow
gradually with context length.

[01:35:04] And

[01:35:09] so, you take the maximum and you see
there is this inflection point here.

[01:35:13] So this is the cost that
Gemini might be paying.

[01:35:18] And then you think, how might you put
a pricing structure on top of that?

[01:35:23] You would like to ensure that no
matter what the context length

[01:35:25] is, you are still profitable.

[01:35:30] So we've got a two-tier pricing structure.

[01:35:31] Maybe we've got something that
looks like this up to some extent.

[01:35:36] I think it says something about,
given that the bump is at 200k, it

[01:35:41] probably means that this is somewhat
aligned with this crossover point.

[01:35:44] Maybe not exactly aligned with it.

[01:35:47] We can actually probably even
complete that calculation just

[01:35:50] to see where it lands out.

[01:35:53] We can solve for the number of bytes
per token if we make some assumptions

[01:35:58] about the number of active parameters.

[01:36:01] So solving for the number of bytes
per token, we're going to assume

[01:36:05] the point where we equalize the time
of memory and the time of compute

[01:36:08] is at, let's say, 200k tokens.

[01:36:12] So we equalize these two.

[01:36:14] We're also going to assume that the batch
size is large enough that the memory

[01:36:20] time spent on weights is negligible.

[01:36:22] So we'll forget about this,
and we'll focus on the actual

[01:36:25] memory time spent on KV cache.

[01:36:29] That ends up saying, copying this term
over, batch times length of context times

[01:36:36] bytes per token over memory bandwidth

[01:36:44] is going to be equal to
the number of activated

[01:36:49] params over FLOPs.

[01:36:54] And then we're going to
solve for bytes per token.

[01:37:18] Batch size was missing here.

[01:37:20] It shows up here, and then it cancels
out by the time we get to here.

[01:37:28] And I dropped the length of context.

[01:37:35] So we can plug in numbers.

[01:37:36] This is the reciprocal of the
number that we saw before.

[01:37:40] This is 1/300, which is reasonably stable
across many different hardware platforms.

[01:37:47] We conjecturally said that
maybe the number of activated

[01:37:50] parameters is a hundred billion.

[01:37:54] The length of the
context we said was 200k.

[01:37:59] Something is wrong here, though.

[01:38:01] Length of the context should

[01:38:20] be on the denominator, not the numerator.

[01:38:22] 1667. Almost two kilobytes.

[01:38:23] That is plausible, actually.

[01:38:27] You said around two kilobytes.

[01:38:35] Let's just do a sanity check
for what this could be.

[01:38:38] There are two mechanisms that
people do attention with a

[01:38:42] small number of bytes per token.

[01:38:44] One is dense attention with
a lot of reuse across layers.

[01:38:50] Character AI has a blog post talking about
that, alternating long and short context.

[01:38:56] In the Character AI kind of model,
which also showed up in the Gemma

[01:38:59] models, the global context—which
is really what we're talking about

[01:39:03] here—was shared across all the layers.

[01:39:06] To get this to kilobytes, you
could get that, for example, as

[01:39:09] a dhead of 128, which is typical.

[01:39:14] Then

[01:39:16] the number of bytes is typically
the number of attention layers

[01:39:26] times two times dhead times
the number of KV heads.

[01:39:39] This is the number of
unique contexts per layer.

[01:39:43] Do you share the context across many
layers, or do you use it only once?

[01:39:49] In the Character AI-like
models, this number is one.

[01:39:54] We said this is 128.

[01:40:00] This is a choice which
typically ranges from one...

[01:40:03] Sorry, this is KV heads, I meant.

[01:40:06] The difference between a
head and a KV head is that…?

[01:40:08] The KV heads are the heads that
are stored in memory, store the

[01:40:13] contents of the previous tokens.

[01:40:14] The Q heads are the retrieval heads.

[01:40:17] They're only used temporarily and
they’re used by the attending token.

[01:40:23] In this autoregressive context, I've
got KV heads associated with all

[01:40:26] of the contexts, and then Q heads
associated with this new token here.

[01:40:30] But this head, the

[01:40:36] 128.

[01:40:37] Oh, sorry.

[01:40:37] This d-head is the
dimension of the vector.

[01:40:39] The

[01:40:41] number of KV heads is typically
in the range of 1 to 8.

[01:40:47] It is totally plausible to get
this by, for example, having 8

[01:40:50] KV heads and a d-head of 128.

[01:40:52] That gives you exactly this number.

[01:40:54] Or you could have fewer
KV heads, but more layers.

[01:41:00] This is one way to get
there via dense attention.

[01:41:02] There's also a way to get there
via sparse attention, where you

[01:41:04] increase all of these numbers, but
then you have a 1/sparsity term.

[01:41:12] I think this number is plausible,
if maybe a little bit small.

[01:41:15] It's funny that they would leak so much
information through their API pricing.

[01:41:18] I mean, you are incentivized to
price close to your costs because

[01:41:22] otherwise someone could scoop you.

[01:41:24] Maybe we can learn something about
the difference in input versus output

[01:41:26] prices, and what that tells us about
decode versus prefill in these models.

[01:41:33] I think last I checked it's 50% more
expensive or something like that?

[01:41:38] I don't remember.

[01:41:39] What I've seen in the past
is 3-5x more expensive.

[01:41:42] Okay, that makes more sense.

[01:41:42] So let's say it's 5x more expensive.

[01:41:45] This is the compute to process
the next token in decode.

[01:41:50] Suppose you're doing prefill, where
you're not just processing the most

[01:41:54] recent token, you're processing
all the tokens in parallel.

[01:41:57] I want to say that it would
be this times length prefill?

[01:42:05] Or length of the pass in general.

[01:42:10] If we can think of decode as
being a pass with one, and then

[01:42:13] prefill being a pass with many.

[01:42:14] Okay.

[01:42:16] So maybe prefix?

[01:42:17] Okay,

[01:42:20] memory.

[01:42:22] You're not storing the KV cache for
the tokens that are the prefill tokens.

[01:42:28] Let's actually draw how prefill
shows up here, if I may clarify.

[01:42:33] We do a bit of decode like this.

[01:42:37] We may actually come
back and do more prefill.

[01:42:40] If you think this is a chat session, the
user says something, the AI generates

[01:42:44] a response, and then the user says
something else and we prefill this.

[01:42:48] Maybe this is the general
case, rather than this.

[01:42:52] In fact, this is like you
read a file or something.

[01:42:54] Read a file or the AI is responding
to a user input, tool call, or

[01:42:58] anything that's not AI-generated.

[01:43:01] Okay, suppose we're here.

[01:43:11] You will have calculated
all of this previously.

[01:43:14] So just the KV of
everything that came before.

[01:43:19] But what is the memory cost of this?

[01:43:22] Well, the

[01:43:26] memory bandwidth cost of this.

[01:43:28] If you're doing flash attention, it would—

[01:43:31] It's basically temporary.

[01:43:33] It doesn't even go to main memory.

[01:43:34] Just ignore that.

[01:43:35] Exactly.

[01:43:35] So then it would just be
everything that came before.

[01:43:39] Is it not just that then?

[01:43:41] There's actually no adjustment
at all to the memory time.

[01:43:42] Okay.

[01:43:43] Great.

[01:43:43] So it's a very trivial
change to accommodate.

[01:43:47] This

[01:43:50] term is making it 5x more expensive.

[01:43:52] Now, why would that be?

[01:43:53] What

[01:43:57] does that actually tell us?

[01:43:58] What variable does this help us clamp?

[01:44:00] The

[01:44:05] only thing that could have
changed is that the compute is

[01:44:06] 5x more expensive as a result.

[01:44:09] This is the time for one pass,
but actually the amount of

[01:44:12] tokens is that much larger.

[01:44:14] We want the cost per token, in
fact, or the time per token.

[01:44:19] I'm not sure I understood.

[01:44:20] This

[01:44:24] is for processing the
next token in prefix?

[01:44:27] Well, actually for
processing the entire batch.

[01:44:31] At this cost, we have processed this
many tokens, the length of prefill.

[01:44:34] Or I guess the length of the pass.

[01:44:34] Not this prefix, but it's this cost.

[01:44:34] Okay.

[01:44:34] Let's just do this pass.

[01:44:34] So this is 5x more expensive.

[01:44:34] Input is 5x more expensive.

[01:44:34] Output is more expensive, in fact.

[01:44:34] Output is 5x more expensive.

[01:44:34] The result we want to work towards is
that prefill is compute-limited and

[01:44:34] decode is memory bandwidth-limited.

[01:44:34] Why don't we do this?

[01:44:34] Why don't we just chart it with len-pass

[01:45:11] on the X-axis and t on the Y-axis.

[01:45:17] We want the cost per
token, so it'll be t over

[01:45:22] length of the pass.

[01:45:28] That'll be

[01:45:32] right.

[01:45:46] I

[01:45:49] guess I’m getting confused by this.

[01:45:50] Len-pass is... It seems like this should
be higher when you're doing prefill.

[01:45:56] Prefill has a bigger length pass.

[01:45:57] Yeah.

[01:45:59] But then why is it cheaper?

[01:46:01] Why is the cost higher?

[01:46:06] It's this division by length pass.

[01:46:12] This is going to divide out, but
then all of this is going to divide

[01:46:16] by length of pass, and it's going
to make the memory costs cheaper.

[01:46:19] Okay.

[01:46:21] Let me think about this then.

[01:46:21] Basically we'll have four different lines.

[01:46:22] Let's do

[01:46:31] prefill first...

[01:46:34] Actually, let's do decode first.

[01:46:39] Length of the pass, when
it's one, that is decode.

[01:46:42] When it is bigger, that is prefill.

[01:46:44] Oh, okay.

[01:46:45] I see.

[01:46:46] That makes sense.

[01:46:47] Getting back to it.

[01:46:48] So tcompute, if you have
basically just this divided by

[01:46:52] len-pass, so just this amount.

[01:46:55] This actually does not vary based on t, so
it'll just be some flat value like this.

[01:47:03] And this is tcompute.

[01:47:09] And

[01:47:12] this is—

[01:47:12] That's decode.

[01:47:13] Decode.

[01:47:13] Right.

[01:47:15] Now tmem, we have this whole
thing divided by len-pass.

[01:47:18] Well, it doesn't really matter
what's up there, it'll just be

[01:47:21] something that looks like this.

[01:47:25] Let's say this is tmem.

[01:47:31] This is decode again.

[01:47:33] So as the length of the prefix goes
up, or pass, your memory bandwidth time

[01:47:46] declines, and that means that to the
extent that you were bottlenecked on

[01:47:51] memory bandwidth before, you can avoid
being bottlenecked on memory bandwidth.

[01:47:56] The fact that they are charging 5x less
for prefill than decode does suggest that

[01:48:04] they are bottlenecked on memory bandwidth
to quite a degree, such that for them at

[01:48:08] least—because t is equivalent to cost,
it's the cost of renting a compute—this

[01:48:16] would be at 1, and this would be at 5.

[01:48:18] That's right.

[01:48:20] So it is, in fact, tremendously
memory bandwidth bottlenecked.

[01:48:23] The real graph looks something like

[01:48:29] that.

[01:48:30] It still crosses, but yeah.

[01:48:32] Exactly.

[01:48:33] Let me do it this way.

[01:48:35] This is

[01:48:44] the gap on decode between the
memory and the compute time.

[01:48:50] Okay, interesting.

[01:48:52] Another interesting one would be
why cache hits are so much cheaper.

[01:48:58] If I remember correctly, cache hits
are like 10x… It's more expensive

[01:49:02] to write to cache according to
the pricing on all these models.

[01:49:06] But if you do hit a cache, it's

[01:49:13] 10x.

[01:49:15] Presumably, this is the cost
of keeping something in HBM

[01:49:19] rather than just evacuating it.

[01:49:22] But if you do keep it in HBM,
then it's cheaper to load again?

[01:49:25] Right.

[01:49:26] There are two ways you can produce the KV

[01:49:30] cache for a token.

[01:49:31] You can just produce it from
scratch by computing it from the

[01:49:34] underlying token IDs, which are tiny.

[01:49:37] Or

[01:49:40] you can previously have produced
it and stored it in a memory

[01:49:45] somewhere.

[01:49:45] The cost ratio is really talking
about the ratio between those

[01:49:48] two mechanisms of producing it.

[01:49:49] A cache miss means you've deleted it
from all your memories, and you have to

[01:49:53] recompute it from the tokens directly.

[01:49:55] You can even take that a step
further and think about which

[01:49:59] memory tier you store it in.

[01:50:01] You could store it in HBM.

[01:50:03] There are other slower and cheaper
memories than HBM, like DDR

[01:50:07] on your host or flash as well.

[01:50:11] One of the things you can do is a
calculation of where it makes sense to be

[01:50:17] in each memory tier, and this is related
to how long you're going to store it for.

[01:50:24] We want to look at the cost of storage
in a few different memory tiers and

[01:50:27] also the cost of rematerialization.

[01:50:32] Remat means the cost to rebuild all
of the KV cache from scratch after you

[01:50:38] deleted it, so we rematerialize it.

[01:50:42] Basically, this is going to
cost the length of the context.

[01:50:48] Actually, we'll look at the cost per
token, so we don't need to carry around

[01:50:52] this length of context everywhere.

[01:50:54] To rematerialize one token of
KV cache, I just need to run a

[01:51:02] forward pass on the whole model.

[01:51:07] This is going to be the compute time.

[01:51:08] I have to rerun the compute at whatever
speed my GPU does it, and then I

[01:51:13] multiply it by my GPU dollars per second.

[01:51:19] Sorry, excuse a naive question.

[01:51:21] Why is there not a quadratic term?

[01:51:24] There is a quadratic term.

[01:51:27] It shows up in the compute.

[01:51:35] As an approximation, I chose to remove it.

[01:51:39] I'll just show you quickly
what that looks like.

[01:51:42] If you look at the

[01:51:47] cost per token, or the number of
FLOPs per token, there are the FLOPs

[01:51:52] that are coming from doing the weight
matrix multiplies as a function of—

[01:51:56] Which is flat.

[01:51:56] ...context length.

[01:51:58] And then there is the number of
multiplies that comes from doing the

[01:52:01] KV cache, which goes up linearly with
the amount of stuff you attend to.

[01:52:07] The slope on this is so low that
when you draw it like this, it's very

[01:52:11] well approximated by a flat line.

[01:52:15] You start to notice the effect of
the quadratic or the linear term

[01:52:18] up in the millions of tokens or so.

[01:52:20] So it's just not super relevant.

[01:52:22] So what is the reason that there's
no company which has over a million

[01:52:26] token context length, if this is true?

[01:52:30] There are two costs of long context.

[01:52:31] One is the memory bandwidth cost, which
we've spent a lot of time analyzing.

[01:52:34] That's this thing.

[01:52:37] The other one is the compute cost.

[01:52:39] The compute cost is
almost always forced by

[01:52:45] fundamental principles to
be a much smaller slope than

[01:52:49] the memory bandwidth cost.

[01:52:52] The primary things that limit you
to really large contexts are memory

[01:52:56] bandwidth and memory capacity,
which is exactly this effect.

[01:53:01] There's this idea that Dario said on
the podcast, and others have said, which

[01:53:04] is, "We don't need continual learning
for AGI, in-context learning is enough."

[01:53:09] If you believe that, then you have
to think that we have to get to a

[01:53:12] hundred-million-token context length to
have an employee that is the equivalent

[01:53:17] of working with you for a month.

[01:53:19] Now, maybe that's no longer true
with sparse attention or something.

[01:53:25] But if you think that, then some ML
infra thing would have to change to

[01:53:29] allow for a hundred million, like
the memory bandwidth, to allow for a

[01:53:33] hundred-million-token context lengths.

[01:53:36] Sparse attention gives you a get-out for
sure, because you get this square root.

[01:53:40] It gives you a big improvement.

[01:53:46] But if you look at the history
of context lengths of models,

[01:53:54] from earlier models like GPT-3, maybe
to GPT-4—I don't remember when the

[01:53:59] transition happened exactly—they
shot up from about 8K to 100-200K.

[01:54:04] And then for the last year or two,
they've all been hovering around there.

[01:54:08] I think that indicates that this
is the reasonably balanced cost

[01:54:13] point, and going massively beyond
that would be cost-prohibitive.

[01:54:17] Not because of the compute cost,
because of the memory bandwidth...

[01:54:19] Because of memory bandwidth cost, yeah.

[01:54:24] I actually don't see a very
good path to solving that.

[01:54:29] The HBM is where it is.

[01:54:34] It's not getting hugely better.

[01:54:35] And why doesn't sparse attention solve it?

[01:54:38] Sparse attention is a big improvement.

[01:54:39] Maybe that is priced in already, perhaps.

[01:54:44] It's not an infinite improvement
because if you go too sparse,

[01:54:47] you lose too much quality.

[01:54:49] The empirical result is that the context
lengths haven't been increasing that much.

[01:54:53] I think it's because there is no
solution to the memory wall here.

[01:55:00] Going too sparse just means you're
attending to a very small subset of the

[01:55:03] tokens, and the quality will get worse.

[01:55:05] Makes sense.

[01:55:05] What is the cost of
these different ways of

[01:55:10] resynthesizing the KV cache?

[01:55:13] Computing it from scratch
is based on my GPU time.

[01:55:15] I have to do a certain amount
of multiplies, of GPU time

[01:55:18] that I spend in order to

[01:55:22] produce it.

[01:55:25] Storing in

[01:55:30] HBM.

[01:55:33] This really goes as my

[01:55:36] bytes per token.

[01:55:39] I need to just have some number
of bytes per token, and then I

[01:55:44] need to store this in the HBM.

[01:55:46] It's going to use up
some of my HBM capacity.

[01:55:50] A way to think of this is that if
I have too many of these things

[01:55:55] sitting in my HBM, if I fill up my
HBM with just KV caches that I'm

[01:55:59] not using, I can't use that GPU.

[01:56:02] How do I price that?

[01:56:03] Maybe I say that the cost
of it is proportional to the

[01:56:06] fraction of the HBM I'm using.

[01:56:08] There's also times GPU dollars.

[01:56:14] Let's just do one more memory tier and say

[01:56:17] store in DDR instead.

[01:56:23] The same kind of thing goes
up for flash and for DDR.

[01:56:27] I put these in the wrong columns.

[01:56:29] I meant to make two columns.

[01:56:32] The distinction I want to make
is that there is the cost to

[01:56:35] retrieve, and then there's a cost to

[01:56:46] hold on.

[01:56:49] This is a cost per second, whereas
this is an instantaneous cost.

[01:56:55] Rematerialization has a cost to
retrieve and has zero cost to

[01:56:58] store it because we've deleted it.

[01:57:02] This is the one that I
put in the wrong location.

[01:57:04] This is actually the cost just
to hold on, so I will rewrite it.

[01:57:27] If we're just storing it in HBM,
it has this sort of cost profile.

[01:57:30] If

[01:57:34] we store in DDR, it's actually
going to take some time.

[01:57:38] We get the same thing here:

[01:57:41] bytes per token over DDR capacity

[01:57:47] times DDR cost per

[01:57:53] second.

[01:57:53] But now this has a cost to retrieve
that is higher than the HBM because

[01:57:58] we need to copy it into the HBM.

[01:58:00] So this is bytes per token

[01:58:06] over

[01:58:09] DDR bandwidth.

[01:58:11] And then this consumes some
amount of the DDR as well.

[01:58:14] And every scale-up has DDR and flash?

[01:58:17] This is really a deployment
question, so you can choose that.

[01:58:20] Nvidia does deploy in this form.

[01:58:23] It has both.

[01:58:24] Why isn't the cost to retrieve HBM

[01:58:28] the bytes divided by memory bandwidth?

[01:58:30] It depends what you
define a retrieve to be.

[01:58:32] Here, I'm defining retrieve to be,
move it into HBM so that you can

[01:58:37] start actually doing inference on it.

[01:58:40] Because if it's already in HBM,
you can be doing compute while

[01:58:43] you're getting it from HBM to SRAM?

[01:58:44] Interesting.

[01:58:44] Yeah, for example.

[01:58:47] These are three things, and
I guess I ordered them wrong.

[01:58:50] In general, if you're balancing
two costs and you've got different

[01:58:54] tiers in the memory hierarchy,
you should expect as this cost

[01:58:58] goes up, this cost should go down.

[01:59:01] You can kind of see where the zeros are.

[01:59:06] I should have ordered them this one first,
this one second, and this one third.

[01:59:12] If you're going to hold onto it for a
very short amount of time, then all of

[01:59:18] this is multiplied by the hold time.

[01:59:24] This one is, and so is this

[01:59:29] one.

[01:59:29] Interestingly, they have
different prices to write for.

[01:59:32] Do you specify this in the API
for five minutes versus an hour?

[01:59:38] Which suggests that the five
minutes is HBM and the hour is DDR.

[01:59:41] I think that's a pretty good assumption.

[01:59:44] If you look at the numbers, it might
also turn out that it's one tier

[01:59:47] down, and it's DDR versus flash.

[01:59:50] Interesting.

[01:59:50] I'll look up the price difference.

[01:59:59] The base input tokens is
$5 per million tokens.

[02:00:04] Base, which means remat.

[02:00:04] This is $5.

[02:00:05] That's $5

[02:00:08] to "retrieve".

[02:00:12] And then to write,

[02:00:21] presumably HBM, for five minutes is 6.25.

[02:00:25] We might be able to determine which
memory tier it is by the durations.

[02:00:35] Five minutes versus one hour.

[02:00:37] Exactly.

[02:00:37] I think this will probably end up being

[02:00:42] the drain time of the
memory tier that you're in.

[02:00:45] What that means is,

[02:00:49] given that I know I'm going
to be holding something for

[02:00:51] five minutes, I would like to

[02:00:55] pick a memory that I can
read every five minutes.

[02:00:58] I can read the whole memory
once per five minutes, ballpark.

[02:01:01] That is the drain time of the memory.

[02:01:02] So if I take the storage
capacity over storage bandwidth,

[02:01:11] I would like this to be
equal to five minutes.

[02:01:16] We did this calculation for HBM.

[02:01:17] For HBM, we know that this
number is 20 milliseconds.

[02:01:21] So HBM is much

[02:01:26] too small.

[02:01:27] DDR could be about an order of
magnitude or two off from this, so

[02:01:30] this is probably on the order of

[02:01:34] seconds, like 1 to 10 seconds.

[02:01:40] I don't have these numbers memorized,
but generally, as you go to

[02:01:42] slower tiers, flash is plausibly
on the order of one minute.

[02:01:46] And then spinning disk, which is massively
different, is on the order of one hour.

[02:01:52] So this might actually identify the
tiers of flash and spinning disk.

[02:01:57] Sorry, why is this the calculation?

[02:01:58] This is the storage capacity
divided by the bandwidth?

[02:02:02] You've got a bunch of different memory
tiers, we've listed four of them.

[02:02:08] Your choice of which memory tier
is about minimizing the cost.

[02:02:15] What fraction of the device are you using?

[02:02:20] You're using some fraction of the
device for holding onto it, and

[02:02:22] then you're using some fraction
of the device to retrieve it.

[02:02:27] Let's say I'm using 10% of the device.

[02:02:31] And I want to equalize
those two fractions.

[02:02:33] That's a sign that I've
hit the right thing.

[02:02:36] Let's say I've got some runtime here.

[02:02:39] I'm going to hold on for all of this time,

[02:02:43] so this is the time-hold.

[02:02:47] And then there's going to be some amount
of time here, which is time-retrieve.

[02:02:55] Basically to equalize these two
costs, I want the retrieval time

[02:03:00] to be equal to the hold time

[02:03:06] times the fraction of capacity.

[02:03:13] Because this is the retrieval
time, this is how many other

[02:03:18] things I can hold simultaneously.

[02:03:20] Basically,

[02:03:22] you want to store things in there
for so long such that the amount of

[02:03:28] time it's in there is the time to
get all your things in there and out.

[02:03:32] Yeah basically.

[02:03:33] I think that probably indicates that the
two tiers are flash and spinning disk.

[02:03:38] I'm kind of shocked to see spinning
disk being used at all, because

[02:03:41] it's such an old technology.

[02:03:43] Interesting.

[02:03:44] It’s also crazy that it’s so
slow that it takes an hour to

[02:03:46] load its full capacity to it in.

[02:03:48] It’s a really unattractive technology
but it’s useful in some places.

[02:03:52] We're sitting down because I
want to ask you some questions

[02:03:54] that don't need a blackboard.

[02:03:56] You have this extremely interesting
blog post where you talk about how,

[02:04:01] at a high level, the architecture
of different cryptographic protocols

[02:04:05] looks a lot like neural networks.

[02:04:08] There's this convergent evolution
where they both need to jumble

[02:04:11] information across all their inputs.

[02:04:13] For cryptographic protocols,
it's to make sure that each new

[02:04:17] input into a hash function will
totally scramble what happens.

[02:04:20] For neural networks, of course, they
need to consider how this piece of

[02:04:25] information changes what you should
make of this other piece of information.

[02:04:29] I thought that was an
extremely interesting point.

[02:04:32] At a high level, in some sense they're
trying to do the inverse thing.

[02:04:38] Cryptographic protocols are trying to take
information which has structure and make

[02:04:43] it look indistinguishable from randomness.

[02:04:45] Neural networks are trying to take
things which look random—protein

[02:04:51] sequences, DNA, garbled text—and
extract higher-level structure from it.

[02:04:58] They have similar high-level
mechanisms, but they're actually

[02:05:01] trying to do the opposite things.

[02:05:04] I wonder what you make of that.

[02:05:10] I try to look for other examples where
mixing and scrambling shows up as well.

[02:05:14] There's almost a physical example
where you're making a cake and

[02:05:19] you want to stir the batter.

[02:05:21] Literally the idea to first stir
it this way and then stir it this

[02:05:23] way is not too bad of an approach.

[02:05:26] Beyond that, back to the digital world,

[02:05:31] there are some differences,
and the one you call out is

[02:05:34] a pretty strong difference.

[02:05:37] The way it shows up,

[02:05:43] if you just randomly initialize a
neural network, maybe it's a reasonable

[02:05:48] cipher as well because the random
initialization is going to jumble

[02:05:51] stuff in a complicated way.

[02:05:52] It may even do what you want.

[02:05:53] Who knows?

[02:05:56] The thing that makes it interpretable
is the gradient descent.

[02:05:59] You can differentiate a neural network
and get a meaningful derivative.

[02:06:04] We do a lot of work to not overcomplicate
the derivative, so the residual

[02:06:10] connection keeps it contained and simple.

[02:06:14] And so does the LayerNorm
stuff that we do.

[02:06:18] One of the biggest attacks against
cryptographic ciphers is also

[02:06:21] to differentiate the cipher.

[02:06:22] Ciphers

[02:06:26] run in a different number field.

[02:06:27] They run in the field of two elements,
so just binary, whereas neural nets run,

[02:06:34] in theory, in the field of real numbers.

[02:06:38] You have to differentiate with
respect to binary numbers, but you

[02:06:43] can absolutely differentiate a cipher.

[02:06:46] This is called differential cryptanalysis.

[02:06:50] Basically, what it says is that if
you take a small difference of the

[02:06:52] input, it's quite difficult to make
the difference of the output be small.

[02:06:58] The whole job of a well-designed
cipher is to make the

[02:07:01] difference in output very large.

[02:07:04] The distinction is that the
optimization goals at that

[02:07:07] point are about complexifying.

[02:07:10] They don't have the same residual
connections, like LayerNorms.

[02:07:14] I guess a place where the two merge is

[02:07:22] backdoors.

[02:07:22] With a backdoor in an LLM, you're
trying to hide… Would you consider it an

[02:07:27] input?

[02:07:28] It’s not an input into the forward pass
but it’s an input into the backward pass.

[02:07:31] You’re trying to hide an
input into the backward pass.

[02:07:34] This is an adversarial

[02:07:39] context?

[02:07:39] This is actually a place where
you get exactly the avalanche

[02:07:44] property that ciphers have as well.

[02:07:49] Adversarial attacks on image
classification models are about finding

[02:07:56] a very small perturbation of the image
that totally changes the classification,

[02:07:59] totally changes the output.

[02:08:01] That is the common case in
ciphers, whereas that's the

[02:08:02] undesired case in neural nets.

[02:08:02] Interesting.

[02:08:02] Has it at all been a successful field to
actually use neural networks as ciphers?

[02:08:02] Almost anything you do in trying to
create a cipher, if it doesn't have 10

[02:08:02] years of scrutiny, it's probably broken.

[02:08:02] So in that direction,
it's a little dangerous.

[02:08:03] In the other direction, there
has been at least one very

[02:08:03] clear adoption of technology.

[02:08:03] There is a construction where you
take a function, an f[x] function,

[02:08:03] which is not invertible, and use
that to build an invertible function.

[02:08:03] That started in ciphers.

[02:08:03] It's called a Feistel
cipher or Feistel network.

[02:08:04] You apply the function f—I want to write
on the blackboard but I won’t—remember

[02:08:05] the input, and then you swap the two.

[02:08:06] That allows you to
construct invertible layers.

[02:08:06] There is a paper from 2018 or 2019
called Reversible Nets, RevNets,

[02:08:06] which does exactly this construction.

[02:08:06] In addition to your residual
connection, you also remember the

[02:08:06] input from the previous layer.

[02:08:06] That actually makes the entire
layer reversible and almost

[02:08:06] completely eliminates your
memory footprint during training.

[02:08:06] Instead of needing to save activations
for the backwards pass, you can

[02:08:06] run the entire network backwards
and rematerialize the activations.

[02:08:07] Ok, so I was asking you,

[02:08:10] have neural networks actually
been used for cryptography?

[02:08:13] And we realized it may be better
to just do this on the blackboard.

[02:08:18] Are they actually being
used for cryptography?

[02:08:20] Using neural nets for cryptography…
In general, creating a new cipher

[02:08:26] is a very dangerous proposition.

[02:08:27] Almost all of them are broken.

[02:08:29] 99% of them are broken, so it’s
probably a bad place to start.

[02:08:34] But the other direction has
been, in at least one very

[02:08:38] clear case, quite productive.

[02:08:41] There's a construction

[02:08:44] that exists in ciphers and then was
imported into neural nets called a

[02:08:48] Feistel cipher, or Feistel network.

[02:08:51] The idea is that you may have some
function f which is not invertible,

[02:09:00] but you like the function because
it does interesting things, like

[02:09:03] it does an MLP, for example.

[02:09:06] Or it mixes it in an interesting way.

[02:09:08] You'd like to build something
out of this that is invertible.

[02:09:11] The construction we're going to make
is going to be a two-input function

[02:09:13] rather than a one-input function.

[02:09:15] We're

[02:09:19] going to apply

[02:09:22] f[x].

[02:09:25] We need to actually remember what x
was, so we're going to stick x over

[02:09:28] here so that we can work backwards,
and then we also can't drop y.

[02:09:33] We're going to remember y, and we're going
to add them together to form this tuple.

[02:09:36] The way to invert this,
if you think I have

[02:09:43] this output and I want to recover
x and y, I can easily recover x.

[02:09:47] That's right there, I just read it off.

[02:09:49] To recover y, if this thing was called
z, I can recover y by z minus f[x],

[02:09:58] because I've already recovered x.

[02:10:01] That means this
construction is invertible.

[02:10:06] This was used in ciphers
a ton and still is used.

[02:10:08] It's one of the main mechanisms
of constructing ciphers.

[02:10:11] Often you want ciphers to be invertible,
especially the layers of ciphers, because

[02:10:16] that has better cryptographic properties.

[02:10:16] This has actually been

[02:10:20] ported over

[02:10:24] into neural nets.

[02:10:25] There's a 2017 paper called
RevNets, reversible networks.

[02:10:32] What it does is make the
entire network invertible.

[02:10:34] You can apply it to any network,
like a transformer network.

[02:10:38] I do a forwards pass, but then I can
run the entire pass backwards as well.

[02:10:42] The whole neural network is invertible
with exactly this construction.

[02:10:48] This paper applied it to some layer,
like a transformer layer, for example.

[02:10:53] We've got this function f,
which is our transformer layer.

[02:10:57] Normally we would have just an
input and then a residual connection

[02:11:01] coming out, and it gets added

[02:11:06] over here.

[02:11:08] Now, the variation of this is going
to be we've got two inputs, x and y.

[02:11:20] x goes through the
function, gets added to y,

[02:11:28] and then this becomes the new x, output x.

[02:11:34] Then this x becomes the output y.

[02:11:40] Really what this is doing, if

[02:11:44] you think of two layers back, is
the thing you mentioned before.

[02:11:48] It's doing the residual
connection from two layers back.

[02:11:52] This y came from the previous layer
and was the residual connection there.

[02:11:56] Because of this construction,
the whole thing is invertible.

[02:12:00] Why do I care?

[02:12:00] What does invertible matter for?

[02:12:02] The big thing that it can be
interesting for is training.

[02:12:05] If I think of a forward pass of training…
Let's say I have four layers and I run

[02:12:10] them in zero, one, two, three order.

[02:12:13] I have to write all of
the activations to HBM.

[02:12:19] I get an HBM footprint
here that is kind of linear

[02:12:24] in the number of layers.

[02:12:30] This can actually be the largest
memory footprint during training.

[02:12:35] This is normal training, and then I run
the backwards pass and read it in reverse.

[02:12:39] The

[02:12:41] forward pass goes forward, and
the backward pass goes backwards.

[02:12:43] I have to read them back out.

[02:12:46] The idea of this RevNets paper is
that because it's invertible, I

[02:12:51] don't need to store this at all.

[02:12:52] I can completely rematerialize it.

[02:12:56] I run my forwards pass, and then
when I'm running my backwards pass,

[02:12:59] I'm simultaneously in lockstep
undoing all of the forwards pass

[02:13:03] steps that I did in order to have
the activations that I need here.

[02:13:08] This ends up being memory
saving, which is a nice idea.

[02:13:11] Interesting.

[02:13:12] In some sense you're spending
more compute to save memory.

[02:13:15] That's right.

[02:13:16] Interesting.

[02:13:17] It's the opposite of what
you're doing with the KV cache.

[02:13:20] With the KV cache, you're spending
more memory to save compute.

[02:13:23] Yeah.

[02:13:25] Spending more memory to save
compute is generally profitable

[02:13:27] given where hardwares are.

[02:13:29] Interesting.

[02:13:30] That was super fun.

[02:13:32] Reiner, thank you so much for doing it.

[02:13:33] I feel like it really
vindicated the vision behind

[02:13:36] the studio and the blackboard.

[02:13:38] Yeah.

[02:13:38] Cool, thanks so much for doing it.

[02:13:39] Thanks.
